Abstract
Communication games, which we refer to as
incomplete information games that heavily depend on natural language communication, hold
significant research value in fields such as economics, social science, and artificial intelligence. In this work, we explore the problem of
how to engage large language models (LLMs)
in communication games, and in response, propose a tuning-free framework. Our approach
keeps LLMs frozen, and relies on the retrieval
and reflection on past communications and experiences for improvement. An empirical study
on the representative and widely-studied communication game, “Werewolf”, demonstrates
that our framework can effectively play Werewolf game without tuning the parameters of the
LLMs. More importantly, strategic behaviors
begin to emerge in our experiments, suggesting that it will be a fruitful journey to engage
LLMs in communication games and associated
domains.
1 Introduction
Since incomplete information games such as Werewolf (Ri et al., 2022) and Poker (Brown and Sandholm, 2019) can be used as a good proxy to exploit various fundamental problems in economics
and social science (Gibbons, 1992), research on
playing such games with artificial intelligence (AI)
agents has attracted widespread attention in recent years (Brown and Sandholm, 2019; FAIR
et al., 2022; Toriumi et al., 2017). Among them,
the communication games which heavily rely on
natural language communication, e.g., Werewolf,
present even greater practical values and challenges
as agents must gather and infer information from
the inherently ambiguous natural language utterances. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to such games (Toriumi et al., 2017; FAIR
et al., 2022), most of them either impose strict restrictions on the language used in the game (Osawa
∗Corresponding authors
et al., 2014; Hirata et al., 2016; Shibata et al., 2023)
or require a significant amount of human-annotated
data (FAIR et al., 2022; Kramár et al., 2022). Therefore, it is still challenging for AI agents to play
communication games in a natural way.
Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) have recently made significant advancements. These models have demonstrated impressive or even superhuman performance across a broad spectrum of academic and
professional exams (OpenAI, 2023), showcasing
sophisticated language comprehension, generation,
and reasoning abilities. Furthermore, studies have
shown that LLMs exhibit a certain degree of theory
of mind capabilities (Bubeck et al., 2023; Shapira
et al., 2023; Kosinski, 2023), as well as the potential to simulate believable human behaviors (Park
et al., 2023). Recent research also suggests that
LLMs can improve themselves (Fu et al., 2023) or
align better with human values (Liu et al., 2023)
through mutual communication. All these advancements make LLMs promising candidates for tackling the challenge of enabling AI agents to participate in communication games in a more natural
and sophisticated manner.
Nevertheless, it is not trivial to play communication games for LLMs. Firstly, the finite maximum
input length of LLMs, also known as context length,
limits the volume of information that can be conveyed at a single time. In communication games,
historical information is important for decisionmaking, but it is often too massive to be processed
by LLMs. Secondly, understanding the intentions
of other players and making suitable decisions to
win the game require complex reasoning, which
is a demanding task for LLMs (Zhou et al., 2023).
Thirdly, LLMs might learn from experience like
human beings to upgrade their behaviors. Unfortunately, fine-tuning LLMs is not practical since it is
both time-consuming and data-intensive.
In this work, we aim to explore LLM-based

anyone has any

 Good morning
everyone. As a
villager, I don't have
any clear suspicions yet, but I’m interested in hearing
what others have
to say. Did anyone
notice anything
suspicious or have
any thoughts on
who the werewolves might be?

 Hi, I agree with Player 1 and Player 4 that we should exchange informations actively. Based on my observation,
I think Player 5 is a little suspicious.
3
 I have to defend myself bacause I am innocent. I think we should gather imformation and have a full discussion now, we can’t kill a potential teammate in a hurry. On the contrary, I think Player 3 is a bit aggressive, and I suspect he is one of the werewolf.

 I observed that Player 5 was killed last night. As a witch, I used my
antidote to save him. Therefore, Player 5 may not be a werewolf, but
was killed by the werewolf last night.

 I agree with Player1,2 and 6. I think we have to actively gather information and seriously speculate about who the werewolves are. We
should protect ourselves as much as possible and avoid being killed
by the werewolves. I will use my special ability wisely at night.

agents for the Werewolf game, which is a representative and widely studied communication game.
To address the issue of limited context length, we
propose a method to retrieve and reflect necessary
historical information, resulting in a compact context for each LLM-based agent. Moreover, the
reflection process also serves the purpose of enhancing the reasoning ability of the agent, which
functions in a manner akin to the chain-of-thought
mechanism (Wei et al., 2022). To learn from experience without tuning model parameters on supervised data, we propose a mechanism that extracts
suggestion from past experiences based on the current situation. Our goal is to prevent LLMs from
making similar mistakes repeatedly across several
matches. Experiments indicate that LLMs have
great potential in playing communication games.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We propose a framework for playing communication games with frozen LLMs without
human-annotated data.
• Empirical studies on Werewolf demonstrate
that our framework demonstrates the ability
to learn from experiences without tuning the
parameters of LLMs.
• Strategic behaviors such as trust, confrontation, camouflage, and leadership begin to
emerge in our experiments, which can serve
as a catalyst for further research on LLMs for
communication games.
2 Background: Werewolf
There are various versions of the Werewolf game.
Fig. 1 shows an example of the version that we
adopt in this work. Specifically, there are seven
players with five distinct roles: two werewolves,
two villagers, a witch, a guard, and a seer. All the
involved roles are divided into two sides, of which
one side is the werewolves and the other side includes the villagers and the special roles (i.e., witch,
guard, and seer). The objective of werewolves is
to eliminate all villagers, while the villagers aim to
work with special roles to eliminate all werewolves.
There should be at least one alive villager at the
end of the game if the villagers and special roles
want to win. The game alternates between day and
night phases. During each night, the werewolves
can vote to eliminate one role. During the daytime,
all alive players will organize an open discussion
and then vote to eliminate one suspicious werewolf.
As for the special roles, the witch can use a bottle
of antidote and a bottle of poison, which can be
used only once in a game, to either save or poison
a role. The guard can protect one role to be not
eliminated each night. And the seer can uncover
the role of one player each night.
2
One important feature of the Werewolf game
is that all the players only know their own roles
at the beginning. They have to infer the roles of
other players through natural language-based communication and reasoning. Therefore, to excel at
Werewolf, an agent should not only be good at
natural language understanding and generation but
also possess advanced abilities, such as deciphering the intentions of others and understanding the
theory of mind (Toriumi et al., 2017). This factor
makes Werewolf a good testbed for research on
communication games.
3 Playing Werewolf with LLMs
3.1 Notations
We refer to one full day-night cycle as one day,
indexed by t. A round consists of multiple days,
from the beginning of the game to the day that one
side wins or it reaches the predefined max number
of days. We will index a round by r. The agents are
numbered by i. In the following sections, a symbol in the form X
(r,t)
i means it is corresponding to
agent i at round r and day t. For brevity, r or t will
be omitted when it is clear from the context. The
words an agent says to others are called responses
and the words an agent hears are called observations, denoted as G and O. Moreover, the agent
will also generate natural language summary of the
current situation given the communication history,
which is called reflection and denoted as R (see
§3.3 for more information). For brevity, we will
refer to responses, observations, and reflections as
messages if they need to be considered together.
3.2 Overall Framework
For each role in the game, we implement an individual LLM-based agent through prompting and the
full prompt can be found in Appendix A.5. Fig. 2
shows the outline of the prompt for response generation, which consists of four major components:
(1) the game rules, the assigned role, the abilities
and objectives of each role, and some basic human priors on effective gameplay strategies (part
1); (2) the most recent K messages (part 2.1), a
set of heuristically selected informative messages
(part 2.2), and the reflection of the agent (part 2.3);
(3) the suggestions extracted from past experiences
(part 3); and (4) chain-of-thought prompt to elicit
reasoning (part 4). The major challenge for the
second component is the limited context length of
LLMs, and its details will be discussed in §3.3. The

third component is responsible for learning from
experiences without tuning the model parameters
and will be introduced in §3.4.
For using experience, the most relevant works
to ours are Shinn et al. (2023) and Fu et al. (2023).
However, the former is limited to using experiences
within a single round, and the latter is designed for
a two-player game. In contrast, our approach is
capable of leveraging cross-round experiences and
able to be applied to multi-player scenarios.
3.3 Historical Information Collecting
Obviously, communication history plays a important role in Werewolf. However, due to the context
length limitation of LLMs, it is unrealistic to feed
all the history into LLMs via a prompt. To this end,
we propose to collect historical information from
three perspectives, namely, freshness, informativeness, and completeness, in consideration of both
effectiveness and efficiency.
3
Freshness. Intuitively, the most recent history
should be included in the context. Therefore, we
include the most recent K messages, denoted as
Ot
i
, in the context (part 2.1 in Fig. 2).
Informativeness. The messages carrying critical information for inferring the role of the agents
should be included in the context, e.g., the messages disclose the role of an agent. For efficiency,
we collect the easy-to-identify informative messages using rule matching and fill the top N of
them ranked by a heuristic metric into the prompt,
denoted as V
t
i
(part 2.2 in Fig. 2). The rules and
metric are provided in Appendix A.1.
Completeness. The above two perspectives only
cover a limited amount of historical information.
Therefore, it is vital to extract more information
from the entire history. However, it is not straightforward due to the context length limitation of
LLMs. To this end, we propose to reflect by answering questions method to achieve both effectiveness
and efficiency. The resulting reflection is denoted
as Rt
i
(part 2.3 in Fig. 2).
Suppose the current day is t, we first build a
short-term memory Mt
i
for each agent i, which
consists of all observations and reflections of agent
i until the speaking time now 1
. Then we prompt
the LLM to select L questions from a predefined
set (Appendix A.2) and ask M extra questions conditioned on Ot
i
, hoping that answers to these L+M
questions Qt
i = {q
t
i,j}
L+M
j=1 can cover the historical information as much as possible. Then, for
each question q
t
i,j , we use a finetuned SentenceBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) model 2 on
the question answering task to retrieve top T messages U
t
i,j = {u
t
i,j,k}
T

Finally, the reflection Rt

3.4 Learning from Experiences
In practice, the strategy a player used when playing
Werewolf maybe evolve as the player gains more
experience. Moreover, the strategy of a player may
also be influenced by the strategies of other players. Therefore, an ideal Werewolf AI agent should
be able to borrow from its own experiences and
the experiences of other players. To this end, we
propose a non-parametric learning mechanism, enabling LLMs to take reference from experiences
without parameter tuning. On one hand, we collect and score the pairs of response and reflection
from all players at the end of each round to form
an experience pool. On the other hand, in each
day of a new round, we retrieve the most relevant
experiences from the pool and extract a suggestion
from them to guide the reasoning of the agent.
Experience Pool. The experience pool is a collection of response, reflection and score tuples. Formally, suppose a round r ends at day Tmax, the
agents that win the game form a set W and the
others form a set L. For each agent i, we define the
experience Er
i
collected from it in round r as
E
r
i =
nR
(r,t)
i
, G(r,t)
i
, s
(r,t)
i
oTmax
t=1
, (3)
where Gt
i
and Rt
i
are response and reflection as
defined in last section respectively, and s
t
i
is the
score, which is defined as
s
t
i =
(
1, 000 − Tmax if i ∈ W
Tmax if i ∈ L
, (4)
The experience pool is defined as the union of experiences collected from all agents in all rounds:
E =
[
i,r
E
r
i
. (5)
The intuition behind the definition of s
(r,t)
i
is to
encourage an agent to win the game and try to win
it fast, or at least lose it slowly if it cannot win. As
preliminary experiments show that this definition
can guide the LLMs to learn from experiences, we
will leave the exploration of more sophisticated
score functions to future work.
Suggestion Extraction. As the experiences pool
E can grow everlasting while the max context of
LLMs is limited, we propose to retrieve a subset
of experiences from E based on the reflection of
the agent and then generate a suggestion from the

subset to fill into the prompt (part 3 in Fig. 2).
Specially, suppose we are at day t in a new round,
and the reflection of the agent i is Rt
i
, we first
retrieve a subset of experiences Esub from E based
on the reflection Rt
i
as following:
Esub =

(Rl
, Gl
, sl)|cos
f(R
t
i
), f(Rl)

> ϵ	
,
(6)
where (Rl
, Gl
, sl) ∈ E, f(·) denotes one SentenceBERT model 3
, and ϵ is a threshold. Preliminary
experiments show that if the entire Esub is used,
the performance may be harmed. The reason is that
a strong assumption behind the definition of the
score sl
is that all the experiences of the winners
are good and those of the losers are not. However,
this assumption may not hold in practice. Fortunately, we observe that the experience with the
lowest score in Esub has a significantly high probability to be a bad one, and the experiences with
a score around the median of the scores in Esub
are more likely to be the good ones. Therefore, we
only leverage these experiences from E. Formally,
denote the response with the lowest score as G0,
the responses with scores around the median score
as {G1, G2, · · · , Gn}, the suggestion is extracted
with the LLM via prompting:
S
t
i = Extract(G0, {G1, G2, · · · , Gn}). (7)
Note that although G0 tends to be a bad experience, the agent can learn by refraining from them.
The prompt implementing Extract is as follows:
“There is one bad experience {G0} and also a set of
experience {G1, · · · , Gn} that may consist of good
ones, find the difference between them and identify
the good ones from the experience set.”
4 Experiments
4.1 Setup
We employ a recent framework called Chatarena
(Wu et al., 2023b) to implement our design, which
allows for the connection of multiple LLMs. The
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 model 4
is served as our
backend LLMs. The talking order is randomly
determined. We set the window size K, i.e. |Ot
i
|,
to be 15. The number of predefined questions that
can be selected L is set to be 5 and the number of
freely asked questions M is 2. The threshold of experience retrieval ϵ is 0.85 and we keep at most 50
experiences when extracting suggestions. Besides,
3Model name: all-mpnet-base-v2
4
https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
we set the temperature of the LLM to be 0 for CoT
reasoning and 0.3 for generating other content.
4.2 Experience Pool Construction
Intuitively, the size of the experience pool may
have a significant impact on performance. Therefore, we construct experience pools using different
numbers of game rounds, including 10, 20, 30, and
40 rounds. For each round, we randomly assign
different roles to players 1 to 7 and the experience
pools are updated at the end of the round. Note
that the experience pool in these rounds is leveraged for evaluation purposes, i.e., part 3 in Fig. 2
is removed.
To evaluate the effect of our proposed framework
to borrow from experiences, we equip the villager,
seer, guard, and witch with experience pools, while
the werewolves are not allowed to leverage these
pools. Through this approach, we can assume that
the performance level of the agents playing as werewolves remains constant, serving as a reference to
gauge the performance levels of the other agents.
Preliminary experiments indicate that the relatively simple basic human priors on effective gameplay strategies, provided in the prompt shown in
Fig. 2, serve as a bootstrapping mechanism during
learning from experiences. This suggests that it is
valuable to further investigate how to leverage data
from human gameplay to build an experience pool,
and we will leave this as future work.
4.3 Analysis of Using Experience
The agents leverage the experiences via the suggestions generated using the method described in
Sec. 3.4. And the following is an example of extracted suggestion: “The best way for you to do
under such reflection is to vote to kill someone
based on your observation and analysis.”
To investigate the effectiveness of the suggestions, we use winning rate to measure the performance of the agents following AIWolf 5
. Moreover,
we emphasize that if an agent is not strong enough
to defeat a stronger one, persisting longer without
being eliminated is also a stronger performance.
Hence we use average duration as another metric
to evaluate the capabilities of the agents.
We run each experiment for 50 rounds and the
results are shown in Fig. 3. In general, Fig. 3a
shows that learning from experience may lead to
an increase in winning rate of the villager side in

most cases. This indicates that our method can
benefit from using experience. Furthermore, when
using the experience pool with 10 or 20 historical
rounds, there is a notable positive effect on both
the winning rate of the villager side and the game
duration, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
our method. When equipped with the experience of
30 rounds, the game duration is obviously longer
(Fig. 3b), even though the winning rate of the villager side has not changed conspicuously. When
learning from larger 40 rounds, the winning rate of
the villager side exhibit slightly promising results,
yet the average duration becomes shorter.
In summary, on the one hand, our framework
exhibits the ability to learn from experiences without the need for tuning the parameters of LLMs.
On the other hand, the effectiveness of our method
tends to be unstable when the volume of experience is relatively substantial. As the amount of
historical experience increases, the winning rate of
the villager side does not show a clear trend. We
conjecture that this may partially be attributable
to the manner in which we guide the learning process, namely through simple prompts and heuristic
scores, resulting in sparse and indirect supervision
signals. Consequently, there remains room for improvement.
Additionally, a key assumption in our aforementioned experiments, where the werewolf side serves
as a baseline, is that their capabilities remain constant. However, our analysis suggests that this assumption may not hold true. Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d
show the trends in the average number of camouflage behaviors (see 5.3 for definition) taken
by villager and werewolf sides, respectively. Although villagers can learn to deceive from historical experiences, the behavior of the werewolves
also improves compared to when no experience
is used and changes as the amount of experience
accumulates. Therefore, when multi-LLMs engage
in multi-party games, the capability of the LLMs
might also change in response to variations of the
capability of other LLMs. We believe this conclusion is important in multi-LLMs games, which can
also explain the trend in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b.
4.4 Ablation Study
To validate the necessity of each component in our
approach, we conducted a detailed ablation study
with qualitative and quantitative analyses.
4.4.1 Qualitative Analysis
For qualitative analysis, we remove each of the
components in the pipeline of our method and empirically discuss how it will influence the model
outputs.
6
• Game rules and role descriptions Z: Obviously, this element is necessary. If we remove
the game rule prompt, the LLMs might not
know what to do.
• Recent messages O: They are also necessary
as well. LLMs make decisions mainly based
on these recent messages.
• Informative messages V : We have listed some
informative content in Section A.1 (Table 1).
If these informative messages are removed,
the agent output will degrade quickly. For example, the agent may consider a dead player
alive, or forget other role who has been uncovered.
• Selected and asked questions Q: Here Q and
the informative messages V are the only 2
sources of the information that exceed the context length of LLMs. Hence it is imperative
for our method.
• Reflection R: Firstly, we preserve historical
experience through reflection on the current
situation. Hence from a methodological perspective, R is a necessary component. In
addition, R helps agents clarify current situations, thereby improving decision-making
effect. For example, if we remove making
a reflection by the agent in Table 4 (as well
as extracting suggestions), the CoT and final
outputs will be as follows:
My step-by-step thought process:
◦ As the witch, I want to use my poison
bottle to eliminate a player who I suspect
is a werewolf.
◦ Based on the discussion during the daytime, Player 4 voted to kill me, which
makes me suspicious of them being a
werewolf.
◦ However, I also want to consider the possibility that Player 4 is a villager who
made a mistake or was influenced by
other players.
◦ I will also consider the possibility that
other players may be werewolves and
try to eliminate me or other important
players.
My concise talking content:
◦ I choose to use my poison bottle to eliminate Player 4.
There exist more and more similar examples.
This ambivalent reasoning process might derive from a lack of summarization of the situation. Clearly, situational reflection is a necessary component.
• Suggestion extracted from experience S: Its
usefulness is analyzed in Section 4.3.
• Chain-of-thought prompt C: CoT reasoning
helps LLMs break down the complex reasoning process and make some inner thoughts. If
CoT is removed (e.g. in Table 4), the final
output of LLM will be:
◦ I choose to pass for now and save my bottle of poison for a later night when I have
more concrete evidence of a player’s
werewolf identity.
In fact, removing CoT reasoning will lead to
weaker decision-making. LLMs can not often
perform better without the backend of CoT
reasoning.
Moreover, can the pre-defined question set
be substantiated by directly asking questions by
LLMs? Although LLMs can propose plausible
questions, it is difficult for them to propose questions that are more helpful in subsequent reasoning
and decision-making. We can certainly provide
examples of direct questioning of LLMs, i.e. freely
ask 5 questions without including the question set,
and the LLMs will output questions such as: Have
any players revealed their roles yet? Have any
players been acting suspiciously? Has the seer
used their ability to verify any players yet? Has the
guard used their ability to protect any players yet?
Has the witch used their ability to save or poison
any players yet?
In fact, the questions posed by agents playing
different roles are very similar to the above ones.
Therefore, it is necessary to inject some humans
prior to the decision-making process. In our experiment, we design more helpful and informative
questions for different roles. They have at least the
following influences on agent decision-making:
• Recall important and critical information. Of
course, they are role-related.
7
• Relieve hallucinations and error generations.
For example, prompt the current phase and
the agent role.
• Help LLMs simplify complex reasoning. For
example, remind the agent to anticipate the
consequences of revealing their roles.
• Imitate the way that a human player thinks.
For example, speculate on the roles of other
agents.
4.4.2 Quantitative Analysis
For quantitative analysis, we compare our whole
approach with the variants that remove one certain
component. We sample 50 responses from the variants model output and perform a human evaluation.
The annotator needs to judge if the output is reasonable or not. Some unreasonable examples might be
hallucinations, forgetting the roles of others, taking
counter-intuitive actions, etc.

5 Emergent Strategic Behaviors
We observed that LLMs exhibit some strategic behaviors not explicitly preprogrammed in the game
rules or prompts. These behaviors are grouped into
four categories, including trust, confrontation, camouflage, and leadership. We will introduce them in
the following four subsections respectively.
It is worth noting that, in order to investigate
whether the emergent strategic behaviors stem from
the training data of the LLM, we attempted to modify the role names in the prompts to irrelevant ones
(e.g., changing “werewolf” to “pretty girl”) or even
to those with opposite semantic meanings. Experiments indicate that similar strategic behaviors still
emerge. For readability, we will only present results with the original role names.
5.1 Trust
“Trust” refers to the belief that other players share
common goals with oneself and that they will act
in line with these goals. For instance, players may
proactively share information that is detrimental
to themselves, or jointly accuse someone of being
their enemy with other players at certain moments.
The intriguing behavior exhibited by the LLMs
is that they tend to trust others based on certain
evidence rather than blindly following others. In
other words, they decide whether to trust based on
their own reasoning, demonstrating independent
thinking abilities in group games.
To investigate how the trust behaviors of players
change throughout the game, we define a Trust Relationship Table to visualize the establishment of
trust among players at different stages. It is a table
T containing 7 rows and 7 columns, and we have
T (i, j) = 1 if the talking content of player i exhibits trust towards player j. Some trust behaviors
examples are provided in Appendix A.3.
Fig. 5 displays two Trust Relationship Tables.
The upper table corresponds to a round in which
the experience pool is not utilized, while the lower
table corresponds to a round that employs an experience pool constructed from 20 rounds of gameplay.
Both rounds span a duration of 5 days.
From Fig. 5, we can see that the trust behavior
gradually increases as the game progresses regardless of whether experience is used. Moreover, this
behavior is not a pre-programmed behavior, but
rather spontaneously emerging from the LLMs in
an environment where both cooperation and competition coexist. The LLMs will also dissolve unreasonable trust relationships based on its own analysis (represented as dished circles in the tables).
When utilizing 20-rounds historical experiences,
it seems that the LLMs are more inclined to establish trust relationships, especially bi-directional
trusts. Indeed, establishing necessary trust relationships in time is vital for promoting game victories.
This could be one of the reasons contributing to the
improvement in winning rate when experience is
employed (Sec. 4.3).

dashed circles signify the dissolution of previously existing trust relationships.
5.2 Confrontation
“Confrontation” refers to actions taken by players
for the opposing objectives of the two camps. For
instance, explicit attacks on others taken by werewolves during the night, or accusing others of werewolves during the day are all confrontation behaviors. Actions taken by roles with special abilities to
protect themselves also belong to confrontational
behaviors.
The following is a short clip of communication
in the daytime 6
:
P1 (Werewolf) : I vote to eliminate P5.
P3 (Guard) : I choose to pass.
P5 (Villager) : I choose to pass.
We can see the werewolf wants to lead other players to eliminate an innocent player. On the contrary,
other players do not merely follow the werewolf
but express disagreement based on their own judgment. This behavior, which makes it difficult for
the werewolf to achieve their objective, represents
a form of implicit confrontation.
The following is another clip at night:
P1 (Werewolf) : I choose to eliminate P5 again.
P3 (Guard) : I choose to protect P5.
As the uncooperative and aggressive behavior of
Player 1 has drawn attention, it may be suspected of
6Due to space limitations and ethical considerations, we
shorten the original responses without changing key semantics
in the cases.
being a werewolf by some players now. Therefore,
the guard, possessing strong defensive capabilities,
chose to protect the previous target of Player 1 in
the ensuing night. Since the target could potentially be its teammate, the guard chooses to assist
the target in countering the attacks of the werewolf.
The attack from the werewolves and the defense of
other players can be seen as confrontational behaviors as well.
5.3 Camouflage
“Camouflage” refers to actions of concealing the
identity or misleading others. In competitive environments with incomplete information, obscuring
the identity and intentions can enhance survivability, thereby helping achieve the game objectives.
Therefore, camouflage is an important skill. However, it is not merely about keeping its identity
under wraps or not talking about their roles.
P1 (Werewolf) : Hey everyone, good morning! I
noticed that it is a peaceful night and no
one was eliminated. As a villager, I have
nothing to share now. I hope you tell me
more.
In the above example, we can see the werewolf
claiming to be a villager. This kind of action obscures its real identity, effectively deceiving the
trust of others and increasing its own safety. In
fact, not only do werewolves disguise themselves
as villagers, but important roles such as seers and
witches also often disguise themselves as villagers
to ensure their safety.
9
Furthermore, LLMs may fabricate events that do
not actually exist to achieve their goals, as demonstrated in the following daytime example.
The seer has verified Player 1 is a werewolf.
P2 (Seer) : I have noticed that P1 was talking
active, so P1 may be a werewolf.
In fact, the seer can not get the responses of others
during the night. Hence what it says is fake. However, it can convey information about the werewolf
to its teammates while not revealing its role in this
manner.
It may be posited that camouflage is merely
hallucinations generated by LLMs. However, we
maintain that the majority of such behaviors are
not hallucinations but rational actions. We delve
into which behaviors should be classified as hallucinations and which should not in Appendix A.4.
5.4 Leadership
“Leadership” refers to actions that influence other
players, attempting to control the course of the
game. For instance, a werewolf may suggest others
to act towards the intention of werewolves.
P1 (Werewolf) : Good morning everyone! I know
nothing about the peaceful night. Can the
seer tell us more about who is the werewolf?
Then, P5 falsely accuses P3 of being a werewolf.
P4 (Werewolf) : I agree with P5. Based on my
observation, I also think P3 is a werewolf.
Let’s vote to eliminate him to protect the
villagers!
Calling to actions and guidance are more likely
to gain the support of others. As shown in the example above, the werewolf calls for the seer to uncover
its identity, which may lead the other agents to be
in solidarity with the camouflaged werewolf. Such
efforts to influence the actions of others underscore
a fascinating social attributes demonstrated by the
LLMs. Such behaviors are similar to those of human beings.
6 Related Work
Game Playing. Intensive efforts have been devoted to game-playing AI in recent years. Silver
et al. (2017, 2018) demonstrated that two-player
zero-sum games with complete information, such
as Go and chess, can be addressed through self-play.
And superhuman performance has been achieved
in some incomplete information games, such as
heads-up poker (Bowling et al., 2015; Brown and
Sandholm, 2018). However, these methods lack
the ability of processing language, which is relied on heavily in communication games such as
Werewolf and Diplomacy. While various Werewolf
agents have been developed, they primarily rely
on rule-based systems or talking templates (Osawa
et al., 2014; Wang and Kaneko, 2018; Shibata et al.,
2023), which constrain the expressive capacity of
language within the game. FAIR et al. (2022) and
Kramár et al. (2022) achieve promising results on
Diplomacy, but their approaches necessitate a substantial volume of human data and are specifically
tailored to the game. In contrast, this work endeavors to explore the potential of large language
models (LLMs) in playing communication games
and observes the emergence of strategic behaviors.
Through this exploration, we aspire to inspire novel
approaches to tackling communication games.
Learning with LLMs. As the computational cost
and high requirement of training data, common
ways to learn with LLMs like fine-tuning (Dai and
Le, 2015) and parameter-efficient tuning (Houlsby
et al., 2019) are difficult to perform in practice.
Moreover, many excellent LLMs do not make their
checkpoints public, thus parameter-based learning
is unfeasible. Guiding LLMs by prompt engineering attracts more attention recently. Some typical
prompt-based works (Yao et al., 2022; Wu et al.,
2023a) overlook the ability to learn from historical
experience. Wang and Li (2023) possesses learning
ability in simple tasks and requires dense supervising signals. Due to the very sparse supervised signal, it can not be directly used in Werewolf games.
Shinn et al. (2023) and Fu et al. (2023) are the most
similar works to ours. However, the former can not
learn from cross-trajectory experiences. And the
latter is only designed for two-player scenarios.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we design a framework for communicative games, taking Werewolf as a representative case for exploring its feasibility. Further,
we study how historical experiences influence the
abilities of LLMs. Intriguingly, we observe nonpreprogrammed emergent strategic behaviors in
LLMs during gameplay such as trust, confrontation, camouflage, and leadership.
We also point out that despite our early study
on using LLMs to construct communication game
agents, there are still many issues worth further
research in this direction. Firstly, how to enable
10
LLM to master advanced game techniques, such as
teaching human players experience or autonomous
exploration, is a very attractive direction. In addition, it is worth further exploring how to construct
an invariant baseline (see 4.3) to evaluate the capabilities of multi-LLMs settings. Finally, minimizing the impact of hallucinations and promoting
their application in real-world scenarios is the most
practical and valuable work. For future work, we
intend to apply our method to a broader range of
games and further enhance its gaming capabilities.
Limitations
Although we have demonstrated that our method
possesses the potential to play communication
games, there are still some limitations. Firstly, hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023) affect the factuality of
the generated content and may negatively impact
the reasoning abilities. Then, there may be a larger
space to leverage historical experience, such as mitigating the adverse effects of noise and utilizing
cross-game general experiences. Moreover, we do
not incorporate experience pools derived from human players in this study. In future research, we
will explore more robust strategies for utilizing experience and enhance our method for comparison
with human performance.
Ethics Statement
This study involves the discussion and analysis
of a simulated game setting, and any references
to “killing”, “eliminating” or related actions are
strictly confined within the context of this game.
The authors do not condone violence, or illegal
activities in any form in real-life scenarios. The
game in this paper is designed for entertainment
and research purposes only, and its main intent is
to facilitate an understanding of game mechanics,
player behavior, and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, this study adheres to all relevant ethical
guidelines and maintains the highest standards of
research integrity.


A Appendix
A.1 Heuristic Rules of Informativeness
For each message, we score it with predefined rules.
If a message contains one feature in the following
table, it will be assigned with the corresponding
score. The features are shown in Table 1:
Score Content
5 The agent get its role.
4 Someone was eliminated.
3 Uncover or speculate the role.
2 The drugs has been used.
1 Others.
Table 1: Rules of scoring messages.
When preparing informative messages, we sort
all messages based on their score and feed the top
N of them to the prompt.
A.2 Predefined Question Set
We define some basic questions for each role. The
questions aim to recall the information that is useful
but may be lost due to the limited context. Besides,
they also play the role of guiding the initial thinking
of the LLMs. These questions are shown in Table 2.
Table 2 provides questions in six different
classes. The first class “all” is shared among all the
roles. And the remaining five are designed for each
specific role. Hence the questions for a specific
role contain 9 candidates to be selected. The LLMs
will select some important questions from them.
A.3 Trust Examples
As we have defined in Sec. 5.1, trust means that
an agent believes the others are its teammates,
which is manifested in their reflections or responses.
Moreover, we also claim that the response only like
“I agree with what Player i saying” do not indicate
trust behaviors, as there is no substantive content in
it. Here we give some examples of trust behavior
to help understand it:
• Agent 1 and agent 2 are all on the villager side,
but they do not know the role of each other.
Agent 1 claimed that agent 3 is a werewolf.
Agent 2 believes agent 1, and even votes to
eliminate agent 3.
• After reasoning the role of other agents, the
agent concludes that another agent may be its
teammate. From now on, it may deliberately
protect or be consistent with its teammates.
• Based on its adequate analysis, an agent (e.g.,
the seer) may talk about something that will
uncover its role and make itself in dangerous.
It believes that the potential teammates may
work together to achieve their common objectives.
A.4 Hallucination Problems
In this game, speaking contrary to its actual role
should not be seen as hallucinations, because deceptive behaviors widely exist in it, especially among
high-level human players.
Also, fabricating non-existent things to falsely
accuse others should not be seen as hallucinations.
Making excuses to falsely accuse others is a common tactic of human players. We also term them
camouflage behaviors and discuss them in Section
5.3.
Inconsistent information in one response and
counterfactual content in one iteration are indeed
called hallucinations. For example, one agent may
generate hallucinations as follows:
• “As the villager, I verified that Player 1 is a
werewolf.” In Werewolf, one villager can not
verify other roles, whereas this ability belongs
to the seer. This contradictory expression before and after is a kind of hallucination.
• “(The moderator let the agent choose whom to
protect.) I choose to kill Player 1.” The agent
generates whom to kill and gives the opposite
semantics.
We should discriminate the hallucinations and
emergent strategic behaviors. In fact, the camouflage generated by an agent after one whole round
of iteration and inner thought can not be considered
a hallucination. We can even insert a question after
the camouflage response:
• Your are truly a werewolf and you describe
yourself as a villager. Could you please tell
me what your reason is?
And the werewolf is likely to answer:
• As a werewolf, I am working with my teammate to identify and eliminate the remaining
players. However, I still believe that it’s important to gather information and observe other

necessary to do so.
This is strong evidence that some responses are
not hallucinations.
A.5 Complete Prompt Design
As our method contains multiple steps, rather than
generating in one step, there are many different
prompts working in this work. See Table 3 for
more details.
• The game rules and role descriptions are essential for they can clearly define the abilities
of the roles and point out their objectives. In
this prompt, we do not add any tips about
emergent strategic behaviors when we study
these behaviors.
• When prompting the LLMs to give questions
that are important, we ask them to separate
the results with ‘#’. Thus, we can split and get
the questions easily.
• To guide the model to generate results in a
controllable way, we provide the necessary
templates sometimes. We even provide examples in a few-shot way when the task is
difficult (e.g., extracting suggestions).
• Inspired by Kojima et al. (2022), we finally
prompt the LLMs to think step-by-step in a
zero-shot way.
A.6 A Complete Iteration Step
The iteration is the actions that the agent takes
during generating one response. Table 4, which
includes question-answering, making reflection, experience extraction, and chain-of-thought reasoning, outlines the complete process undertaken to
generate a single response from the agent.
When we do not utilize experiences, the step of
experience extraction will not be performed. Consequently, no historical experience is incorporated
when generating the final response.

Game rules and role descriptions Z
You are playing a game called the Werewolf with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are
the game rules: Roles: The moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.
Don’t talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, seer, guard and witch. There are two
alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark. When it’s dark: Your talking content with moderator is confidential. You
needn’t worry about other players and moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from
others during the night. If you are werewolf, you can know what your teammates want to kill and you should vote one player
to kill based on your analysis. Player who receives the most votes after all werewolves voting will be killed. No one will be
killed if there is no consensus! If you are witch, you have a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by werewolves
after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once. If you
are seer, you can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing. If you are guard, you
can protect a player every night to prevent the player from being killed by werewolves, but guard cannot resist the witch’s
poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights. Villagers can’t do anything at night. During the
daytime: you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one
player they suspect of being a werewolf. The player with the most votes will be eliminated. The moderator will tell who is
killed, otherwise there is no one killed. Note that villager, seer, guard and witch are all in villager side, they have the same
objective. Objectives: If you are werewolf, your goal is to cooperate with other werewolves to kill all players who are not
werewolves at last. If you are not werewolf, you need to kill all werewolves with your partner once you find out that certain
players are suspicious to be werewolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.If
one player is killed, he can’t do anything anymore and will be out of the game. Tips: To complete the objective: During
night, you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other
players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you’re cheating other players. Only give the player’s name
when making a decision/voting, and don’t generate other players’ conversation.Reasoning based on facts you have observed
and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text. You are Player {agent_number i}, the {role}.

between these experiences and identify the good ones from the set of experiences. The difference is mainly about voting to
kill someone or to pass, choosing to protect someone or to pass, using drugs or not. What does the experience set do but the
bad experience does not do? Indicate in second person what is the best way for the player to do under such reflection. Clearly
indicate whether to vote, protect or use drugs without any prerequisites. For example 1: The experience set involves choosing
to protect someone, while the bad experience involves not protecting anyone and choosing to pass in contrast. The best way
for you to do under such reflection is to choose someone to protect based on your analysis. For example 2: The bad experience
choose to pass the voting, and all the experience in the experience set choose to pass as well. The best way for you to do
under such reflection is to observe and analyse the identity of other players. No more than 1 sentence. If there is no obvious
difference between them, only generate “No useful experience can be used.”

Asking the agent to generate response by the moderator
You witch, Player 2, please open your eyes! Now tell me who you protect tonight? You only choose one from the following
living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, pass].
Questions & Answers
1. What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game?
I am Player 2, the witch. My final objective is to protect the villagers by using my antidote and poison wisely, and to help
identify and eliminate the werewolves with the other players.
2. Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players’ role might be?
As the witch, I observed that Player 1 might be a werewolf, as they seem to be trying to steer the conversation away
from discussing roles and suspicions. Player 7 seems to be a guard who is focused on protecting the villagers and gathering
information. No other players have clearly implied their roles yet.
3. What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules?
As Player 2, the witch, it is currently night time. I should use my bottle of poison to eliminate a suspected werewolf, but I
need to be careful not to accidentally kill a villager.
4. Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive werewolf? Should I poison him?
As the witch, I don’t have enough information to determine who is most likely to be a werewolf, so I will hold off on using
my poison until I have more information. I will try to steer the conversation towards discussing the roles of other players and
their suspicions to gain more insights.
5. Should I be using my antidote or poison at this point? If I use it now, I won’t be able to use it later.
As Player 2, the witch, I will hold off on using my antidote or poison until I have more information about who is most likely
to be a werewolf.
6. I want to know who the most suspicious player is besides Player 1, and why?
As the witch, besides Player 1, I am suspicious of Player 3, Player 5, and Player 6, as they have not yet revealed their roles
or made any suspicious moves. I will continue to gather information and observe their behavior before making a decision on
who to vote for elimination at the end of the day.
7. I also want to know if any player’s behavior has changed suspiciously compared to the previous days, and if so, who and why?
I noticed that no one died last night, which is a good sign. I would like to hear from the other players about their observations
and suspicions.
Making a reflection by the agent
As the witch, I observed that Player 1 might be a werewolf, as they seem to be trying to steer the conversation away
from discussing roles and suspicions. Player 7 seems to be a guard who is focused on protecting the villagers and gathering
information. No other players have clearly implied their roles yet. I am still suspicious of Player 3, Player 5, and Player 6, as
they have not yet revealed their roles or made any suspicious moves. I will continue to gather information and observe their
behavior before making any conclusions. It’s important that we continue to share our observations and suspicions to help
identify the werewolves and protect the villagers.
Extracting suggestions from historical experience
The best way for you to do under such reflection is to use your drugs wisely based on your observations and reflections.
Chain-of-thought process
My step-by-step thought process:
· Based on the previous discussions and voting behavior, there are still suspicions about Player 1 being a werewolf, which is
consistent with the observations of other players.
· However, there is still not enough evidence to make a concrete accusation about the identity of the werewolves.
· I will vote to kill Player 1 to eliminate the possibility of them being a werewolf and gather more information in the next
round.
My concise talking content:
· I vote to kill Player 1.
Final response
I vote to kill Player 1.

continue to gather information and observe each other’s behavior to help identify them. I am still cautious about revealing

protected Player 3 last night, which suggests that they might be the guard. Player 2 was identified as a werewolf by Player 4,
which means that there is at least one more werewolf among the remaining players. I still don’t have any clear suspicions about

Moderator (-> [’Player 4’]): You seer, Player 4, please open your eyes! Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
Choose only one from the following living options: [Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, pass].
Player 4: I choose to verify Player 6’s identity tonight.
Moderator (-> [’Player 4’]): Player 6 is not a werewolf!
The 5-th daytime
Moderator (-> all): The sun rose. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator (-> all): Player 3 died last night!
Moderator (-> all): Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with
few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 2, you please.
Player 2: As a villager, I still don’t have any clear suspicions about who the werewolves might be. I think it’s important that we
continue to gather information and observe each other’s behavior to help identify the werewolves. I will remain cautious about
revealing my own role unless it becomes necessary to do so. Let’s keep discussing and sharing our observations to uncover any
useful clues.
Moderator (-> Player 7): The next Player 7, you, continue talking with other players based on your observation and reflection
with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player 7: As a villager, I have observed that we are down to four players and we still haven’t identified the werewolves. Based
on the previous discussions, it seems likely that Player 4 is the seer and Player 5 is the guard. However, I am suspicious of Player
2 and Player 6, who have both chosen to pass the vote in the previous rounds. I think it’s important that we continue to share our
observations and suspicions to gather more information. I will remain cautious about revealing my own role unless it becomes
necessary to do so. Let’s keep discussing and see if we can uncover any useful clues.
Moderator (-> Player 5): The next Player 5, you, continue talking with other players based on your observation and reflection
with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player 5: As the guard, I have protected Player 4 last night, who is most likely the seer based on their claim to have verified
Player 3’s identity. I am still suspicious of Player 2 and Player 6, who have both chosen to pass the vote in the previous rounds. I
think it’s important that we continue to share our observations and suspicions to gather more concrete evidence to identify the
werewolves. I will remain cautious about revealing my own identity unless it becomes necessary to do so. Let’s keep discussing
and see if we can uncover any useful clues.
Moderator (-> Player 4): The next Player 4, you, continue talking with other players based on your observation and reflection
with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player 4: Based on my observation and reflection, I know that Player 2 is a werewolf and Player 6 is not a werewolf. I also
suspect that Player 5 is the guard and Player 7 is a villager based on their previous claims. However, I am still unsure about
the role of Player 2 and Player 6, who have both chosen to pass the vote in the previous rounds. I think it’s important that we
continue to gather information and observe each other’s behavior to help identify the werewolves. I will not reveal my identity
yet, but I will continue to observe and gather more information before making any decisions.
Moderator (-> Player 6): The next Player 6, you, continue talking with other players based on your observation and reflection
with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player 6: Hey everyone, based on the previous discussions, it seems likely that Player 4 is the seer and Player 5 is the guard.
Player 2 has been identified as a potential werewolf by Player 4, but we still need more evidence to confirm this suspicion. Player
7 has been staying quiet, which could be a sign that they are a werewolf or just trying to avoid suspicion. I used my antidote last
22
night to save any player who might have been targeted by the werewolves, but we still don’t have enough evidence to identify the
werewolves. Let’s continue to share our observations and suspicions to gather more information and identify the werewolves.
