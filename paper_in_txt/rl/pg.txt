Policy Gradient Method For Robust Reinforcement Learning
Yue Wang 1 Shaofeng Zou 1
Abstract
This paper develops the first policy gradient
method with global optimality guarantee and complexity analysis for robust reinforcement learning
under model mismatch. Robust reinforcement
learning is to learn a policy robust to model mismatch between simulator and real environment.
We first develop the robust policy (sub-)gradient,
which is applicable for any differentiable parametric policy class. We show that the proposed robust
policy gradient method converges to the global
optimum asymptotically under direct policy parameterization. We further develop a smoothed
robust policy gradient method, and show that to
achieve an -global optimum, the complexity is
O(
−3
). We then extend our methodology to the
general model-free setting, and design the robust
actor-critic method with differentiable parametric policy class and value function. We further
characterize its asymptotic convergence and sample complexity under the tabular setting. Finally,
we provide simulation results to demonstrate the
robustness of our methods.
1. Introduction
In practical reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto,
2018) applications, the training environment may often
times deviate from the test environment, resulting in a model
mismatch between the two. Such model mismatch could be
because of, e.g., modeling error between simulator and realworld applications, model deviation due to non-stationarity
of the environment, unexpected perturbation and potential
adversarial attacks. This may lead to a significant performance degradation in the testing environment.
To solve the issue of model mismatch, a framework of robust
Markov decision process (MDP) was introduced in (Bag1Department of Electrical Engineering, University at Buffalo, New York, USA. Correspondence to: Shaofeng Zou

nell et al., 2001; Nilim & El Ghaoui, 2004; Iyengar, 2005),
where the MDP model is not fixed but comes from some
uncertainty set. The goal of robust RL is to find a policy
that optimize the worst-case performance over all possible
MDP models in the uncertainty set. Value-based approaches
have been extensively studied under the tabular setting and
with function approximation, e.g., (Iyengar, 2005; Nilim
& El Ghaoui, 2004; Badrinath & Kalathil, 2021; Wiesemann et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2017; Tamar et al., 2014; Lim
et al., 2013; Bagnell et al., 2001; Satia & Lave Jr, 1973;
Xu & Mannor, 2010; Wang & Zou, 2021). There are also
other approaches that are shown to be successful empirically, e.g., based on adversarial training, (Vinitsky et al.,
2020; Pinto et al., 2017; Abdullah et al., 2019; Hou et al.,
2020; Rajeswaran et al., 2017; Atkeson & Morimoto, 2003;
Morimoto & Doya, 2005; Huang et al., 2017; Kos & Song,
2017; Lin et al., 2017; Pattanaik et al., 2018; Mandlekar
et al., 2017), which however lack theoretical robustness and
optimality guarantee.
The policy gradient method (Williams, 1992; Sutton et al.,
1999; Konda & Tsitsiklis, 2000; Kakade, 2001), which models and optimizes the policy directly, has been widely used
in RL thanks to its ease of implementation in model-free setting, scalability to large/continuous state and action spaces,
and applicability to any differentiable policy parameterization. Despite a large body of empirical and theoretical
work on policy gradient method, development of policy
gradient approach for robust RL with provable robustness
to model mismatch and optimality guarantee still remains
largely open in the literature.
In this paper, we develop the first policy gradient method
for robust RL under model mismatch with provable robustness, global optimality and complexity analysis. In this
paper, we focus on the R-contamination uncertainty set
model (Huber, 1965; Du et al., 2018; Huber & Ronchetti,
2009; Wang & Zou, 2021; Nishimura & Ozaki, 2004; Prasad
et al., 2020a;b). Our robust policy gradient method inherits
advantages of vanilla policy gradient methods and their variants, and provide provable guarantee on global optimality
and robustness. In particular, the challenges and our major
contributions are summarized as follows.
• Robust RL aims to optimize the worst-case performance,
named robust value function, where the worst-case is

Policy Gradient Method For Robust Reinforcement Learning
taken over some uncertainty set of MDPs. However, the
robust value function involves a “max” and thus may not
be differentiable in the policy. Our first contribution in
this paper is the development of robust policy gradient,
where we derive the Frechet sub-gradient of the robust ´
value function, and further show that it is the gradient
almost everywhere. We would like to highlight that our
robust policy gradient applies to any differentiable and
Lipschitz policy class.
• Motivated by recent advancements on the global optimality of vanilla policy gradient methods, we are interested
in a natural question that whether the global optimum of
robust RL can be attained by our robust policy gradient
method. The major challenge lies in that the robust value
function involves a “max” over the uncertainty set, and
thus has a much more complicated landscape than the
vanilla value function. We consider the direct parametric policy class and show that the robust value function
satisfies the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition (Polyak,
1963; Lojasiewicz, 1963), and our robust policy gradient
method converges to a global optimum almost surely.
• The robust value function may not be differentiable everywhere, which is the major challenge in the convergence
rate analysis. We then design a smoothed robust policy
gradient method as an approximation, where the corresponding smoothed objective function is differentiable.
We show that smoothed robust policy gradient method
converges to an -global optimum of the original nondifferentiable robust RL problem with a complexity of
O(
−3
).
• To understand the fundamentals of our robust policy gradient method, our results discussed so far focus on the ideal
setting assuming perfect knowledge of the (smoothed)
robust policy gradient. Although this is a commonly used
setting in recent studies of vanilla policy gradient, e.g.,
(Agarwal et al., 2021; Cen et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2020;
Bhandari & Russo, 2019), such knowledge is typically unknown in practice and need to be estimated from samples.
We then focus on the model-free setting, where only samples from the centroid of the uncertainty set are available,
and we design a model-free robust actor-critic algorithm.
Our robust actor-critic can be applied with arbitrary differential parametric policy class and value function approximation in practice. Theoretically, we prove the global
optimality of our robust actor critic method under the
tabular setting with direct parametric policy class.
1.1. Related Works
Global optimality of vanilla policy gradient method. In
the non-robust setting, policy gradient methods (Williams,
1992; Sutton et al., 1999) as well as their extensions (Sutton
et al., 1999; Konda & Tsitsiklis, 2000; Kakade, 2001; Schulman et al., 2015; 2017) have been successful in various
applications, e.g., (Schulman et al., 2015; 2017). Despite
the surge of interest in policy gradient methods, theoretical
understanding remains limited to convergence to local optimum and stationary points. It was not until recently that
the global optimality of various policy gradient methods
was established (Bhandari & Russo, 2021; 2019; Agarwal
et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Laroche & des
Combes, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021a; Cen et al., 2021; Zhang
et al., 2020a; Lin, 2022). In this paper, we focus on policy
gradient methods for robust RL. The major new challenge
lies in that the robust value function is not differentiable
everywhere, and the landscape of the robust value function
is much more complicated than the vanilla value function.
Value-based approach for robust RL. Robust MDP
was introduced and studied in (Iyengar, 2005; Nilim &
El Ghaoui, 2004; Bagnell et al., 2001; Satia & Lave Jr,
1973; Wiesemann et al., 2013; Lim & Autef, 2019; Xu &
Mannor, 2010; Yu & Xu, 2015; Lim et al., 2013; Tamar
et al., 2014), where the uncertainty set is assumed to be
known to the learner, and the problem can be solved using
dynamic programming. Later, the studies were generalized
to the model-free setting where stochastic samples from the
central MDP of the uncertainty set are available in an online
fashion (Roy et al., 2017; Badrinath & Kalathil, 2021; Wang
& Zou, 2021; Tessler et al., 2019) and an offline fashion
(Zhou et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021; Panaganti & Kalathil,
2021; Goyal & Grand-Clement, 2018; Kaufman & Schaefer, 2013; Ho et al., 2018; 2021; Si et al., 2020). In this
paper, we focus on approaches that model and optimize the
policy directly, and develop robust policy gradient method.
Our method inherits advantages of policy gradient, and has
a broader applicability than value-based method for largescale problems.
Direct policy search for robust RL. Robust policy gradient method for constrained MDP was studied in (Russel
et al., 2020), however, there are mistakes in the gradient
derivation. More specifically, the fact that the worst-case
transition kernel is a function of the policy was ignored
when deriving the gradient. A recent paper (Derman et al.,
2021) showed the equivalence between robust MDP and
regularized MDP, and developed a policy gradient method
for the case with only reward uncertainty. In (Derman et al.,
2021), it was discussed that it is difficult to their methods
extend to problems with uncertain transition kernel because
of the dependency between the worst-case transition kernel
and the policy. (Eysenbach & Levine, 2021) showed a similar result that maximum entropy regularized MDP is robust
to model mismatch. In this paper, we focus on the challenging problem with uncertain transition kernel, and derive the
robust policy gradient. We also note that a separate line of
work (Zhang et al., 2021c;b) studies the corruption-robust
Policy Gradient Method For Robust Reinforcement Learning
RL problems, where the goal is to learn a robust policy to
data corruption, and is fundamentally different from the
problem in this paper.
2. Preliminaries
Markov Decision Process. An MDP (S, A, P, c, γ) is specified by: a state space S, an action space A, a transition
kernel P = {p
a
s ∈ ∆(S), a ∈ A, s ∈ S}
1
, where p
a
s
is the
distribution of the next state over S upon the agent taking
action a in state s, a cost function c : S × A → [0, 1], and
a discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1). At each time step t, the agent
in state st takes an action at. The environment then transits
to the next state st+1 according to the distribution p
at
st
, and
provides a cost signal c(st, at) ∈ [0, 1] to the agent.
A stationary policy π : S → ∆(A) maps any state to a
distribution over the action space A. More specifically, in
state s, the agent takes action a with probability π(a|s). The
value function of a stationary policy π starting from s ∈
S measures the expected accumulated discounted cost by
following policy π: E [
P∞
t=0 γ
t
c(St, At)|S0 = s, π], and
the goal is to find a policy that minimizes the value function
for any initial state s ∈ S.
Robust MDP. The transition kernel of the robust MDP is
not fixed but is from some uncertainty set P. In this paper,
we focus on the (s, a)-rectangular uncertainty set (Nilim &
El Ghaoui, 2004; Iyengar, 2005), i.e., P =
N
s,a P
a
s
, where
P
a
s ⊆ ∆(S). At each time step, after the agent takes an
action, the environment transits to the next state following
any transition kernel P ∈ P, and the choice of kernels
can be time-varying. A sequence of transition kernel κ =
(P0, P1...) ∈
N
t≥0 P can be viewed as a policy chosen by
the nature and is referred to as the nature’s policy.
The robust value function of a policy π is defined as the
worst-case expected accumulated discounted cost over κ
when following π and starting from s:

point (Nilim & El Ghaoui, 2004; Iyengar, 2005; Puterman,

Define the expected worst-case total cost function under the
initial distribution ρ as Jρ(π) , ES∼ρ[V

(S)]. The goal of
the agent is to find an optimal policy that minimizes Jρ(π):
minπ Jρ(π).
R-Contamination Uncertainty Set. In this paper, we
focus on an adversarial model of the uncertainty set, Rcontamination, where the nature could arbitrarily perturb
the state transition of the MDP with a small probability.
Let P =
N
s∈S,a∈A p
a
s be a transition kernel. The Rcontamination uncertainty set centered at P is defined as
P ,
N
s,a P
a
s
, where
P
a
s , {(1 − R)p
a
s + Rq|q ∈ ∆(S)} , s ∈ S, a ∈ A. (3)
This uncertainty set model is widely used in the literature
of robust learning and optimization, e.g., (Huber, 1965; Du
et al., 2018; Wang & Zou, 2021; Huber & Ronchetti, 2009;
Nishimura & Ozaki, 2004; 2006; Prasad et al., 2020a;b).
The R-contamination set models the scenario where the
state transition could be arbitrarily perturbed with a small
probability R, hence is more suitable for systems suffering
from random perturbations, adversarial attacks, and outliers
in sampling. R-contamination set can also be connected to
uncertainty sets defined by total variation, KL-divergence
and Hellinger distance via inequalities, e.g., Pinsker’s inequality. On the other hand, the R-contamination model is
more clean and straightforward, which makes the derivation of the robust policy gradient, and the convergence and
complexity analyses tractable.
Under the R-contamination model, the support function can
be easily computed as follows:

3. Robust Policy Gradient
Consider a parametric policy class ΠΘ = {πθ : θ ∈ Θ}.
Denote Jρ(πθ) by Jρ(θ). Robust RL aims to find an optimal
policy πθ
∗ ∈ ΠΘ that minimizes the expected worst-case
accumulated discounted cost:
θ
∗ ∈ arg min
θ∈Θ
Jρ(θ). (5)
Let J
∗
ρ
, minθ∈Θ Jρ(θ). Recall the definition of V
π
(s) in
(1). Due to the max over κ, V
π
(s) may not be differentiable.
To solve this issue, we adopt the Frechet sub-differential ´
(Kruger, 2003)

Definition 3.1. For a function f : X ⊆ R
N → R, a vector
u ∈ R
N is called a Frechet sub-differential of ´ f at x, if

f(x + h) − f(x) − hh, ui
khk
≥ 0. (6)
The set of all the sub-differential of f at x is denoted by
∂f(x).
Clearly, when f(x) is differentiable at x, ∂f(x) =
{∇f(x)}.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the parametric
policy class is differentiable and Lipschitz.
Assumption 3.2. The policy class ΠΘ is differentiable and
kπ-Lipschitz, i.e., for any s ∈ S, a ∈ A and θ ∈ Θ, there
exists a universal constant kπ, such that k∇πθ(a|s)k ≤ kπ.
This assumption can be easily satisfied by many policy
classes, e.g., direct parameterization (Agarwal et al., 2021),
soft-max (Mei et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,
2021a; Wang & Zou, 2020), or neural network with Lipschitz and smooth activation functions (Du et al., 2019;
Neyshabur, 2017; Miyato et al., 2018).

πθ (s).
Then, the (sub-)gradient of Jρ(θ) can be computed in the
following theorem.
Theorem 3.3. (Robust Policy Gradient) Consider a class of
policies ΠΘ satisfying Assumption 3.2. For any distribution

Then, (1) almost everywhere in Θ, Jρ(θ) is differentiable
and ψρ(θ) = ∇Jρ(θ); and (2) at non-differentiable θ,
ψρ(θ) ∈ ∂Jρ(θ).
If we set R = 0, i.e., the uncertainty set P reduces to a
singleton {P} and there is no robustness, then ψρ(θ) in (7)
reduces to the vanilla policy gradient (Sutton et al., 1999).
As can be seen from (7), the robust policy (sub)-gradient is
a function of the robust Q-function. Note that in robust RL,
Jρ(θ) may not be differentiable everywhere, and therefore,
the sub-gradient is needed. The mistake in (Russel et al.,
2020) is due to the ignorance of the dependence of the
worst-case kernel on θ, and their robust policy gradient is a
function of the vanilla Q-function not the robust Q-function,
which should not be the case.
In policy gradient approaches, the agent often has the challenge of exploration. If ρ highly concentrates on a subset of
S, then the agent may not be able to explore all the states
and may end up with a sub-optimal solution. To solve this
issue, we introduce an optimization measure µ satisfying
µmin , mins µ(s) > 0 (Agarwal et al., 2021). The initial
state distribution ρ is called the performance measure. As
we will show in the next section, although we want to minimize Eρ[V
π
], we can perform sub-gradient descent with
respect to Jµ , Eµ[V
π
] and the algorithm can still find an
optimum of Eρ[V
π
].
Given the robust policy gradient in Theorem 3.3, we design our robust policy gradient algorithm in Algorithm 1.
We note that our Algorithm 1 can be applied to any arbitrarily parameterized policy class that is differentiable and
Lipschitz. Here Q
Θ denotes the projection onto Θ.

4. Global Optimality: Direct
Parameterization
In this section, we show that the robust objective function Jρ(θ) satisfies the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition when the direct parametric policy class is used, i.e.,
Θ = (∆(A))|S|
and πθ(a|s) = θs,a, and we further show
the global optimality of Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 is in fact a sub-gradient descent algorithm for
a non-convex function Jµ. Following classic results from
stochastic approximation and optimization (Beck, 2017;
Borkar, 2009; Borkar & Meyn, 2000), Algorithm 1 is expected to converge to stationary points only. Showing the
global optimality requires further characterization of Jµ,
which involves the “max” over κ, and is thus more challenging than the vanilla non-robust case.
We first show that the robust objective function Jρ satisfies
the PL-condition under the direct parameterization. Informally, a function f(θ) is said to satisfy the PL condition
if f(θ) − f(θ
∗
) ≤ O(F(∇f(θ))), for some suitable scalar
notion of first-order stationarity F, which measures how
large the gradient is (Karimi et al., 2016; Bolte et al., 2007a).
This condition implies that if a solution is close to some
first-order stationary point, the function value is then close
to the global optimum.
Theorem 4.1 (PL-Condition). Under direct policy parame-

performance measure ρ ∈ ∆(S),

ρ ≤ CP L max
πˆ∈(∆(A))|S|
hπθ − π, ψ ˆ µ(θ)i, (8)
where CP L =
1
(1−γ)µmin
.
Note that ψµ(θ) on the right hand side of (8) is a subgradient of Jµ, and Jρ(θ) on the left hand side of (8) is
the objective function with respect to ρ. Therefore, for any
optimization measure µ, a stationary point of Jµ is a global
optimum of Jρ. Thus the PL-condition in Theorem 4.1 with
results from stochastic approximation will lead to the global
optimality of Algorithm 1 in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.2. If αt > 0,
P∞
t=0 αt = ∞ and P∞
t=0 α
2
t <
∞, then Algorithm 1 converges to a global optimum of Jρ(θ)
almost surely.
Theorem 4.2 suggests that our robust policy gradient algorithm converges to a global optimum, which matches
the global optimality results for vanilla policy gradients
in e.g., (Agarwal et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2020). However, the analysis here is much more challenging due to
the non-differentiable objective function and min-max problem structure.
5. Smoothed Robust Policy Gradient
It is in general challenging to analyze the convergence rate
of Algorithm 1, which is a projected sub-gradient descent
algorithm for non-differentiable non-convex function. In
this section, we construct a smoothed approximation Jσ,ρ,
which converges to Jρ as σ → ∞. We develop a smoothed
robust policy gradient, and show that the smoothed Jσ,ρ
satisfies the PL-condition. We characterize its global optimality and show that to achieve an -global optimal, the
complexity is O(
−3
).
For convenience, in the remaining of this paper we assume
that ρ = µ and ρmin > 0, and we omit the subscript ρ in Jρ
and Jσ,ρ. The algorithm design and theoretical results can
be similarly extended to the general setting with ρ 6= µ as
in Section 3 and Section 4.
We use the LogSumExp (LSE) operator to approximate the
max operator, where
LSE(σ, V ) = log(Pd
i=1 e
σV (i)
)
σ
for V ∈ R
d
and some σ > 0. The approximation error
|LSE(σ, V ) − max V | → 0 as σ → ∞. By replacing max

The reason why we do not use soft-max is because with
soft-max, the induced Bellman operator is not a contraction
anymore (Asadi & Littman, 2017; Wang & Zou, 2021).
With LSE, Tπ
σ
is a contraction and has a unique fixed point
(Wang & Zou, 2021), which we denote by V

and name as
the smoothed robust value function. We can also define the

and let J

as σ → ∞. In the
following theorem, we derive the gradient of Jσ, which
holds for any differentiable policy class.

We then design the smoothed robust policy gradient algorithm in Algorithm 2.

5.1. Global Optimality Under Direct Parameterization
We focus on direct policy parameterization. We show
that the smoothed objective function Jσ satisfies the PLcondition and develop the global optimality of Algorithm 2.

This theorem implies that if the gradient ∇Jσ(θ) is small,
then θ falls into a small neighbour (radius of O(σ

. By choosing a large σ, the difference
between Jσ (θ)−J

the global optimality with respect to J

can be established.
5.2. Convergence Rate
We then study the convergence rate of Algorithm 2 under
direct policy parameterization. We first make an additional
smoothness assumption on ΠΘ.
Assumption 5.3. ΠΘ is lπ-smooth, i.e., for any s ∈ S and
a ∈ A and for any θ1, θ2 ∈ Θ,
k∇πθ1
(a|s) − ∇πθ2
(a|s)k ≤ lπkθ1 − θ2k. (13)
Then under Assumption 5.3, we show that Jσ is Lσ-smooth.
Lemma 5.4. Under Assumptions 3.2 and 5.3, for any θ1, θ2,
k∇Jσ(θ1) − ∇Jσ(θ2)k ≤ Lσkθ1 − θ2k, (14)
where Lσ = O(σ) and its exact definition is in (89).
The value of σ controls the tradeoff between the smoothness
of Jσ and the approximation error between Jσ and J.

Theorem 5.5 shows that Algorithm 2 converges to an -
global optimum within O(
−3
) steps. This rate is slower
than the one of non-robust policy gradient in (Agarwal et al.,
2021) by a factor of O(
−1
), which is due to the additional
robustness requirement and the smoothing technique using
σ. If we set R = 0, i.e., no robustness, the value of σ will
then be irrelevant, and our algorithm reduces to non-robust
policy gradient algorithm. With R = 0, Lσ = O(1) and
Cσ = O(1), then our complexity also reduces to O(
−2
),
which is the same as the one in (Agarwal et al., 2021).
6. Robust Actor-Critic
The results discussed so far assume full knowledge of robust value functions and visitation distributions, and thus
the (smoothed) robust policy gradient is exactly known.
Although this is a commonly used setting for theoretical
analysis e.g., in (Agarwal et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2020;
Bhandari & Russo, 2019; Cen et al., 2021), such knowledge
is usually unknown in practice. In this section, we focus on
the practical model-free setting where only training samples
from the centroid transition kernel P can be obtained.
2Cσ =
1
1−γ
(1 + 2γRlog |S|
σ
) denotes the upper bound of Q
π
σ.
As can be seen from (7) and (11), to obtain the (smoothed)
robust policy (sub)-gradient, we first need to estimate the
robust value function. Robust value function measures the
performance on the worst-case transition kernel which is typically different from the one that generates samples. However, Monte Carlo (MC) method can only be used to estimate
the value function on the kernel that generates the samples.
To solve this issue, we design a robust TD algorithm, and
combine it with our robust policy gradient descent to design the robust actor-critic algorithm. Consider a parametric
robust action value function Qζ , e.g., linear function approximation, neural network. The robust TD algorithm is given
in Algorithm 3. Note that by replacing max in the algorithm
by LSE we can also get the smoothed robust TD algorithm
to estimate V

We provide the convergence proof of robust TD under the
tabular setting in Appendix C.1. For convergence under
general function approximation, additional regularity conditions might be needed (Korda & La, 2015; Dalal et al., 2018;
Bhandari et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2017).
With the robust TD algorithm, we then develop our robust
actor-critic algorithm in Algorithm 4. The algorithm can be
applied with any differentiable value function approximation and parametric policy class.
We then smooth and specialize Algorithm 4 to the tabular
setting with direct policy parameterization (see Algorithm 6
in Appendix C.2 for the details). We derive the global
optimality and convergence rate for smoothed robust actorcritic in the following theorem. In the algorithm, we set
Tc large enough so that kQTc − Qπ
σk∞ ≤ est, where for
est denotes the estimate error of robust value function. We
note that the smoothed robust TD algorithm in Algorithm 5
can be shown to converges to an est-global optimum with
O(

Zou, 2021).

An explicit bound can be found in (161) in the Appendix.
The sample complexity of Robust TD (Algorithm 5) is

7. Numerical Results
In this section, we demonstrate the convergence and robustness of our algorithms using numerical experiments.
We test our algorithms on the Garnet problem (Archibald
et al., 1995) and the Taxi environment from OpenAI (Brockman et al., 2016). The Garnet problem can be specified by G(Sn, An), where the state space S has Sn states
(s1, ..., sSn
) and action space has An actions (a1, ..., aAn
).
The agent can take any actions in any state, but only gets
reward r = 1 if it takes a1 in s1 or takes a2 in other states (it
will receive 0 reward in other cases). The transition kernels
are randomly generated.
7.1. Robust v.s. Non-robust Policy Gradient
We first compare our robust policy gradient method with
vanilla policy gradient. To show the robustness of our algorithm over the vanilla policy gradient method, we compare
their robust value functions, i.e., worst-case performance,
for different values of R. We first train the robust policy gradient algorithm and store the obtained policy θt at each time
step. At each time step, we run robust TD in Algorithm 5
with a sample size 200 for 30 times to estimate the average
objective function value J(θt). We then plot J(θt) v.s. the
number of iterations t on the Garnet problems G(12, 6) and
G(20, 10) in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively, and plot
results on the Taxi environment from OpenAI in Figure 3.
We do the same for the vanilla policy gradient method. The
upper and lower envelopes of the curves correspond to the
95 and 5 percentiles of the 30 curves, respectively.
As can be seen from Figure 1, when R = 0, the robust
policy gradient method reduces to the non-robust vanilla
policy gradient, and our results show both algorithms have
the same performance. When R > 0, the robust policy
gradient obtains a policy that performs much better than the
non-robust vanilla policy gradient, which demonstrates the
robustness of our method.

7.2. Smoothed Robust Policy Gradient
In this section, we demonstrate the performance of our
smoothed robust policy gradient method on the Garnet problem G(12, 6). As we showed in Section 5, the smoothed
algorithm approximate the robust policy gradient algorithm
as σ → ∞. Here, we set different values of σ in Algorithm
2 and plot their objective functions v.s. number of iterations

to demonstrate such an approximation.
As shown in Figure 4, when σ is small (e.g., σ = 1), the
performance of smoothed robust policy gradient is poor.
As σ increases, smoothed robust policy gradient behaves
similarly to the robust policy gradient, which corresponds
to the curve with σ = ∞. This experiment hence verifies
our theoretical results that we can approximate the robust
policy gradient by choosing a suitably large σ.
(a) R = 0.1. (b) R = 0.15.

7.3. Robust Actor-Critic
In Figure 5, we consider Garnet problem G(30, 20) using
neural network parameterized policy, where we use a twolayer neural network with 15 neurons in the hidden layer
to parameterize the policy πθ. We then use a two-layer
neural network (with 20 neurons in the hidden layer) in the
critic. At each time step, we run Algorithm 3 for 30 times to
estimate the robust value function. We then use the estimate
to simulate Algorithm 4. We plot J(θt) v.s. the number of
iterations in Figure 5, and the upper and lower envelopes
of the curves correspond to the 95 and 5 percentiles of the
30 trajectories. As the results show, our robust actor-critic
algorithm finds a policy that achieves a higher accumulated
discounted reward on the worst-case transition kernel than
the vanilla actor-critic algorithm (Sutton & Barto, 2018).
(a) R = 0.15. (b) R = 0.2.

7.4. Comparison with RARL
We compare our robust algorithms with the robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) approach in (Pinto et al.,
2017). The basic idea of the RARL approach is to introduce
an adversary that perturbs the state transition to minimize
the accumulated discounted reward. Then the agent and the
adversary are trained alternatively using adversarial training.
To apply their algorithm to our problem setting, we set an adversarial player, whose goal is to minimize the accumulated
discounted reward that the agent receives. The action space
Aad of the adversary is the state space Aad , S. The agent
and the adversary take actions aa, aad, then the environment
will transit to state aad with probability R or transit following the unperturbed MDP p
aa
s with probability 1 − R. We
compare our robust actor-critic algorithm with the RARL
algorithm on the Taxi environment. Similarly, at each time
step, we run Algorithm 3 with neural function approximation for 30 times to estimate the robust value function. We
then use the results to simulate Algorithm 4 and RARL. We
plot the robust value function J(θt) v.s. the number of iterations in Figure 6. The upper and lower envelops correspond
the 95 and 5 percentiles of the 30 trajectories. As Figure 6
shows, our robust actor-critic algorithm achieves a much
higher accumulative discounted reward than the RARL approach under the worst-case transition kernel, and thus is
more robust to model mismatch.
8. Discussions
In this paper, we develop direct policy search method for robust RL. Our robust algorithms can be applied with arbitrary
differentiable value function approximation and policy parameterization, and thus is scalable to problems with large

state and action spaces. In this paper, the analysis is for
the direct policy parameterization. Our approach can also
be extended to establish the global optimality under other
policy parameterizations, e.g., softmax. It is also of future
interest to develop robust natural policy gradient approaches
for robust RL. We focus on the R-contamination model
for the uncertainty set, which can be closely related to sets
defined by total variation and Kullback-Leibler divergence
using Pinsker’s inequality. It is also of future interest to
investigate model-free approaches for other uncertainty sets
defined via e.g., total variation, Kullback-Leibler divergence,
Wasserstain distance.
