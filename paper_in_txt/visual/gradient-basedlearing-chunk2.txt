One of the main points of the next several sections is
to show that GradientBased Learning procedures are not
limited to networks of simple modules that communicate
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  
through xedsize vectors but can be generalized to GTNs
Gradient backpropagation through a Graph Transformer
takes gradients with respect to the numerical informa
tion in the output graph and computes gradients with re
spect to the numerical information attached to the input
graphs and with respect to the modules internal param
eters GradientBased Learning can be applied as long as
di	erentiable functions are used to produce the numerical
data in the output graph from the numerical data in the
input graph and the functions parameters
The second point of the next several sections is to show
that the functions implemented by many of the modules
used in typical document processing systems and other
image recognition systems though commonly thought to
be combinatorial in nature are indeed di	erentiable with
respect to their internal parameters as well as with respect
to their inputs and are therefore usable as part of a globally
trainable system
In most of the following we will purposely avoid making
references to probability theory All the quantities manip
ulated are viewed as penalties or costs which if necessary
can be transformed into probabilities by taking exponen
tials and normalizing
V Multiple Object Recognition Heuristic
OverSegmentation
One of the most dicult problems of handwriting recog
nition is to recognize not just isolated characters but
strings of characters such as zip codes check amounts
or words Since most recognizers can only deal with one
character at a time we must rst segment the string into
individual character images However it is almost impos
sible to devise image analysis techniques that will infallibly
segment naturally written sequences of characters into well
formed characters
The recent history of automatic speech recognition 


 is here to remind us that training a recognizer by opti
mizing a global criterion at the word or sentence level is much preferable to merely training it on handsegmented
phonemes or other units Several recent works have shown
that the same is true for handwriting recognition 
 op
timizing a wordlevel criterion is preferable to solely train
ing a recognizer on presegmented characters because the
recognizer can learn not only to recognize individual char
acters but also to reject missegmented characters thereby
minimizing the overall word error
This section and the next describe in detail a simple ex
ample of GTN to address the problem of reading strings of
characters such as words or check amounts The method
avoids the expensive and unreliable task of handtruthing
the result of the segmentation often required in more tra
ditional systems trained on individually labeled character
images
A Segmentation Graph
A now classical method for word segmentation and recog
nition is called Heuristic OverSegmentation 
 
 Its
main advantages over other approaches to segmentation are
Fig  Building a segmentation graph with Heuristic Over Segmentation
that it avoids making hard decisions about the segmenta
tion by taking a large number of di	erent segmentations
into consideration The idea is to use heuristic image pro
cessing techniques to nd candidate cuts of the word or
string and then to use the recognizer to score the alter
native segmentations thereby generated The process is
depicted in Figure  First a number of candidate cuts
are generated Good candidate locations for cuts can be
found by locating minima in the vertical pro jection prole
or minima of the distance between the upper and lower
contours of the word Better segmentation heuristics are
described in section X The cut generation heuristic is de
signed so as to generate more cuts than necessary in the
hope that the correct
 set of cuts will be included Once
the cuts have been generated alternative segmentations are
best represented by a graph called the segmentation graph The segmentation graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG
with a start node and an end node Each internal node is
associated with a candidate cut produced by the segmen
tation algorithm Each arc between a source node and a
destination node is associated with an image that contains
all the ink between the cut associated with the source node
and the cut associated with the destination node An arc
is created between two nodes if the segmentor decided that
the ink between the corresponding cuts could form a can
didate character Typically each individual piece of ink would be associated with an arc Pairs of successive pieces
of ink would also be included unless they are separated by
a wide gap which is a clear indication that they belong
to di	erent characters Each complete path through the
graph contains each piece of ink once and only once Each
path corresponds to a di	erent way of associating pieces of
ink together so as to form characters
B Recognition Transformer and Viterbi Transformer
A simple GTN to recognize character strings is shown
in Figure  It is composed of two graph transformers
called the recognition transformer Trec and the Viterbi
transformer Tvit  The goal of the recognition transformer
is to generate a graph called the interpretation graph or
recognition graph Gint  that contains all the possible inter
pretations for all the possible segmentations of the input
Each path in Gint represents one possible interpretation of
one particular segmentation of the input The role of the
Viterbi transformer is to extract the best interpretation
from the interpretation graph
The recognition transformer Trec takes the segmentation
graph Gseg as input and applies the recognizer for single
characters to the images associated with each of the arcs

Fig  Recognizing a character string with a GTN For readability only the arcs with low penalties are shown
in the segmentation graph The interpretation graph Gint

except that each arc is replaced by a set of arcs from and
to the same node In this set of arcs there is one arc for
each possible class for the image associated with the cor
responding arc in Gseg  As shown in Figure  to each
arc is attached a class label and the penalty that the im
age belongs to this class as produced by the recognizer If
the segmentor has computed penalties for the candidate
segments these penalties are combined with the penalties
computed by the character recognizer to obtain the penal
ties on the arcs of the interpretation graph Although com
bining penalties of di	erent nature seems highly heuristic
the GTN training procedure will tune the penalties and
take advantage of this combination anyway Each path in
the interpretation graph corresponds to a possible inter
pretation of the input word The penalty of a particular
interpretation for a particular segmentation is given by the
sum of the arc penalties along the corresponding path in
the interpretation graph Computing the penalty of an in
terpretation independently of the segmentation requires to
combine the penalties of all the paths with that interpre
tation An appropriate rule for combining the penalties of
parallel paths is given in section VIC
The Viterbi transformer produces a graph Gvit with a
single path This path is the path of least cumulated
penalty in the Interpretation graph The result of the
recognition can be produced by reading o	 the labels of

VI Global Training for Graph Transformer
Networks
The previous section describes the process of recognizing
a string using Heuristic OverSegmentation assuming that
the recognizer is trained so as to give low penalties for the
correct class label of correctly segmented characters high
penalties for erroneous categories of correctly segmented
characters and high penalties for all categories for badly
formed characters This section explains how to train the
system at the string level to do the above without requiring
manual labeling of character segments This training will
be performed with a GTN whose architecture is slightly
di	erent from the recognition architecture described in the
previous section
In many applications there is enough a priori knowl
edge about what is expected from each of the modules in
order to train them separately For example with Heuris
tic OverSegmentation one could individually label single
character images and train a character recognizer on them
but it might be dicult to obtain an appropriate set of
noncharacter images to train the model to reject wrongly
segmented candidates Although separate training is sim
ple it requires additional supervision information that is
often lacking or incomplete the correct segmentation and
the labels of incorrect candidate segments Furthermore
it can be shown that separate training is suboptimal 

The following section describes three di	erent gradient
based methods for training GTNbased handwriting recog
nizers at the string level Viterbi training discriminative
Viterbi training forward training and discriminative for ward training The last one is a generalization to graph
based systems of the MAP criterion introduced in Sec
tion IIC Discriminative forward training is somewhat
similar to the socalled Maximum Mutual Information cri
terion used to train HMM in speech recognition However
our rationale di	ers from the classical one We make no
recourse to a probabilistic interpretation but show that
within the GradientBased Learning approach discrimina
tive training is a simple instance of the pervasive principle
of error correcting learning
Training methods for graphbased sequence recognition
systems such as HMMs have been extensively studied in
the context of speech recognition 
 Those methods re
quire that the system be based on probabilistic generative
models of the data which provide normalized likelihoods
over the space of possible input sequences Popular HMM
learning methods such as the the BaumWelsh algorithm
rely on this normalization The normalization cannot be
preserved when nongenerative models such as neural net works are integrated into the system Other techniques
such as discriminative training methods must be used in
this case Several authors have proposed such methods to
train neural networkHMM speech recognizers at the word


The GTN techniques presented below simplify and gen
eralize the global training methods developed for speech
recognition
A Viterbi Training
During recognition we select the path in the Interpre
tation Graph that has the lowest penalty with the Viterbi
algorithm Ideally we would like this path of lowest penalty
to be associated with the correct label sequence as often as
possible An obvious loss function to minimize is therefore
the average over the training set of the penalty of the path
associated with the correct label sequence that has the low est penalty The goal of training will be to nd the set of
recognizer parameters the weights if the recognizer is a
neural network that minimize the average penalty of this
correct
 lowest penalty path The gradient of this loss
function can be computed by backpropagation through
the GTN architecture shown in gure  This training
architecture is almost identical to the recognition archi
tecture described in the previous section except that an
extra graph transformer called a path selector is inserted
between the Interpretation Graph and the Viterbi Trans
former This transformer takes the interpretation graph
and the desired label sequence as input It extracts from
the interpretation graph those paths that contain the cor
rect dired label sequence Its output graph Gc is called
the constrained interpretation graph also known as forced
alignment in the HMM literature and contains all the
paths that correspond to the correct label sequence The
constrained interpretation graph is then sent to the Viterbi
transformer which produces a graph Gcvit with a single
path This path is the correct
 path with the lowest
penalty Finally a path scorer transformer takes Gcvit and
simply computes its cumulated penalty Ccvit by adding up
the penalties along the path The output of this GTN is
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  
the loss function for the current pattern
Evit  Ccvit 
The only label information that is required by the above
system is the sequence of desired character labels No
knowledge of the correct segmentation is required on the
part of the supervisor since it chooses among the segmen
tations in the interpretation graph the one that yields the
lowest penalty The process of backpropagating gradients through the
Viterbi training GTN is now described As explained in
section IV the gradients must be propagated backwards
through all modules of the GTN in order to compute gra
dients in preceding modules and thereafter tune their pa
rameters Backpropagating gradients through the path
scorer is quite straightforward The partial derivatives of
the loss function with respect to the individual penalties on
the constrained Viterbi path Gcvit are equal to  since the
loss function is simply the sum of those penalties Back
propagating through the Viterbi Transformer is equally
simple The partial derivatives of Evit with respect to the
penalties on the arcs of the constrained graph Gc are 
for those arcs that appear in the constrained Viterbi path
Gcvit and  for those that do not Why is it legitimate
to backpropagate through an essentially discrete function
such as the Viterbi Transformer The answer is that the
Viterbi Transformer is nothing more than a collection of
min functions and adders put together It was shown in
Section IV that gradients can be backpropagated through
min functions without adverse e	ects Backpropagation
through the path selector transformer is similar to back
propagation through the Viterbi transformer Arcs in Gint that appear in Gc have the same gradient as the corre
sponding arc in Gc ie  or  depending on whether the
arc appear in Gcvit The other arcs ie those that do
not have an alter ego in Gc because they do not contain
the right label have a gradient of  During the forward
propagation through the recognition transformer one in
stance of the recognizer for single character was created
for each arc in the segmentation graph The state of rec
ognizer instances was stored Since each arc penalty in
Gint is produced by an individual output of a recognizer
instance we now have a gradient  or  for each out
put of each instance of the recognizer Recognizer outputs
that have a non zero gradient are part of the correct an
swer and will therefore have their value pushed down The
gradients present on the recognizer outputs can be back
propagated through each recognizer instance For each rec
ognizer instance we obtain a vector of partial derivatives
of the loss function with respect to the recognizer instance
parameters All the recognizer instances share the same pa
rameter vector since they are merely clones of each other
therefore the full gradient of the loss function with respect
to the recognizers parameter vector is simply the sum of
the gradient vectors produced by each recognizer instance
Viterbi training though formulated di	erently is often use
in HMMbased speech recognition systems

gorithms have been applied to speech recognition systems
that integrate neural networks with time alignment

While it seems simple and satisfying this training ar
chitecture has a aw that can potentially be fatal The
problem was already mentioned in Section IIC If the
recognizer is a simple neural network with sigmoid out
put units the minimum of the loss function is attained
not when the recognizer always gives the right answer but
when it ignores the input and sets its output to a constant vector with small values for all the components This is
known as the col lapse problem The collapse only occurs if
the recognizer outputs can simultaneously take their min
imum value If on the other hand the recognizers out
put layer contains RBF units with xed parameters then
there is no such trivial solution This is due to the fact
that a set of RBF with xed distinct parameter vectors
cannot simultaneously take their minimum value In this
case the complete collapse described above does not occur
However this does not totally prevent the occurrence of a
milder collapse because the loss function still has a at
spot
 for a trivial solution with constant recognizer out
put This at spot is a saddle point but it is attractive in
almost all directions and is very dicult to get out of using
gradientbased minimization procedures If the parameters
of the RBFs are allowed to adapt then the collapse prob
lems reappears because the RBF centers can all converge
to a single vector and the underlying neural network can
learn to produce that vector and ignore the input A dif
ferent kind of collapse occurs if the width of the RBFs are
also allowed to adapt The collapse only occurs if a train
able module such as a neural network feeds the RBFs The
collapse does not occur in HMMbased speech recognition
systems because they are generative systems that produce
normalized likelihoods for the input data more on this
later Another way to avoid the collapse is to train the
whole system with respect to a discriminative training cri
terion such as maximizing the conditional probability of
the correct interpretations correct sequence of class labels
given the input image
Another problem with Viterbi training is that the
penalty of the answer cannot be used reliably as a mea
sure of condence because it does not take lowpenalty or
highscoring competing answers into account
B Discriminative Viterbi Training
A modication of the training criterion can circumvent
the collapse problem described above and at the same time
produce more reliable condence values The idea is to not
only minimize the cumulated penalty of the lowest penalty
path with the correct interpretation but also to somehow
increase the penalty of competing and possibly incorrect
paths that have a dangously low penalty This type of
criterion is called discriminative because it plays the good
answers against the bad ones Discriminative training pro
cedures can be seen as attempting to build appropriate
separating surfaces between classes rather than to model
individual classes independently of each other For exam

ple modeling the conditional distribution of the classes
given the input image is more discriminative focussing
more on the classication surface than having a separate
generative model of the input data associated to each class
which with class priors yields the whole joint distribu
tion of classes and inputs This is because the conditional
approach does not need to assume a particular form for the
distribution of the input data
One example of discriminative criterion is the di	erence
between the penalty of the Viterbi path in the constrained
graph and the penalty of the Viterbi path in the uncon
strained interpretation graph ie the di	erence between
the penalty of the best correct path and the penalty of
the best path correct or incorrect The corresponding
GTN training architecture is shown in gure  The left
side of the diagram is identical to the GTN used for non
discriminative Viterbi training This loss function reduces
the risk of collapse because it forces the recognizer to in
creases the penalty of wrongly recognized ob jects Dis
criminative training can also be seen as another example
of error correction procedure which tends to minimize the
di	erence between the desired output computed in the left
half of the GTN in gure  and the actual output com
puted in the right half of gure 
Let the discriminative Viterbi loss function be denoted
Edvit and let us call Ccvit the penalty of the Viterbi path in
the constrained graph and Cvit the penalty of the Viterbi
path in the unconstrained interpretation graph
Edvit  Ccvit  Cvit 
Edvit is always positive since the constrained graph is a
subset of the paths in the interpretation graph and the
Viterbi algorithm selects the path with the lowest total
penalty In the ideal case the two paths Ccvit and Cvit
coincide and Edvit is zero
Backpropagating gradients through the discriminative
Viterbi GTN adds some negative
 training to the pre
viously described nondiscriminative training Figure 
shows how the gradients are backpropagated The left
half is identical to the nondiscriminative Viterbi training
GTN therefore the backpropagation is identical The gra
dients backpropagated through the right half of the GTN
are multiplied by  since Cvit contributes to the loss with
a negative sign Otherwise the process is similar to the left
half The gradients on arcs of Gint get positive contribu
tions from the left half and negative contributions from the
right half The two contributions must be added since the
penalties on Gint arcs are sent to the two halves through
a Y
 connection in the forward pass Arcs in Gint that
appear neither in Gvit nor in Gcvit have a gradient of zero
They do not contribute to the cost Arcs that appear in
both Gvit and Gcvit also have zero gradient The  contri
bution from the right half cancels the the  contribution
from the left half In other words when an arc is rightfully
part of the answer there is no gradient If an arc appears
in Gcvit but not in Gvit the gradient is  The arc should
have had a lower penalty to make it to Gvit If an arc is
in Gvit but not in Gcvit the gradient is  The arc had a
low penalty but should have had a higher penalty since it
is not part of the desired answer
Variations of this technique have been used for the speech
recognition Driancourt and Bottou 
 used a version of
it where the loss function is saturated to a xed value
This can be seen as a generalization of the Learning Vector
Quantization  LVQ loss function 
 Other variations
of this method use not only the Viterbi path but the K
best paths The Discriminative Viterbi algorithm does not
have the aws of the nondiscriminative version but there
are problems nonetheless The main problem is that the
criterion does not build a margin between the classes The
gradient is zero as soon as the penalty of the constrained
Viterbi path is equal to that of the Viterbi path It would
be desirable to push up the penalties of the wrong paths
when they are dangerously close to the good one The
following section presents a solution to this problem
C Forward Scoring and Forward Training
While the penalty of the Viterbi path is perfectly appro
priate for the purpose of recognition it gives only a partial
picture of the situation Imagine the lowest penalty paths
corresponding to several dierent segmentations produced
the same answer the same label sequence Then it could
be argued that the overall penalty for the interpretation
should be smaller than the penalty obtained when only one
path produced that interpretation because multiple paths
with identical label sequences are more evidence that the
label sequence is correct Several rules can be used com
pute the penalty associated to a graph that contains several
parallel paths We use a combination rule borrowed from
a probabilistic interpretation of the penalties as negative
log poeriors In a probabilistic framework the posterior
probability for the interpretation should be the sum of the
posteriors for all the paths that produce that interpreta
tion Translated in terms of penalties the penalty of an
interpretation should be the negative logarithm of the sum
of the negative exponentials of the penalties of the individ
ual pathThe overall penalty will be smaller than all the
penalties of the individual paths
Given an interpretation there is a well known method
called the forward algorithm for computing the above quan
tity eciently 
 The penalty computed with this pro
cedure for a particular interpretation is called the forward
penalty Consider again the concept of constrained graph
the subgraph of the interpretation graph which contains
only the paths that are consistent with a particular label
sequence There is one constrained graph for each pos
sible label sequence some may be empty graphs which
have innite penalties Given an interpretation running
the forward algorithm on the corresponding constrained
graph gives the forward penalty for that interpretation
The forward algorithm proceeds in a way very similar to
the Viterbi algorithm except that the operation used at
each node to combine the incoming cumulated penalties
instead of being the min function is the socalled logadd
operation which can be seen as a soft
 version of the min

Note that because of numerical inaccuracies it is better
to factorize the largest exi corresponding to the smallest

An interesting analogy can be drawn if we consider that
a graph on which we apply the forward algorithm is equiv
alent to a neural network on which we run a forward prop
agation except that multiplications are replaced by addi
tions the additions are replaced by logadds and there are
no sigmoids

about multiplicative scores eg probabilities instead of
additive penalties on the arcs score  exp penalty  In
that case the Viterbi algorithm selects the path with the
largest cumulative score with scores multiplied along the
path whereas the forward score is the sum of the cumula
tive scores associated to each of the possible paths from the
start to the end node The forward penalty is always lower
than the cumulated penalty on any of the paths but if one
path dominates
 with a much lower penalty its penalty
is almost equal to the forward penalty The forward algo
rithm gets its name from the forward pass of the wellknown
BaumWelsh algorithm for training Hidden Markov Mod
els 
 Section VIIIE gives more details on the relation
between this work and HMMs
The advantage of the forward penalty with respect to
the Viterbi penalty is that it takes into account all the
di	erent ways to produce an answer and not just the one
with the lowest penalty This is important if there is some
ambiguity in the segmentation since the combined forward
penalty of two paths C and C associated with the same
label sequence may be less than the penalty of a path C
associated with another label sequence even though the
penalty of C might be less than any one of C or C The Forward training GTN is only a slight modica
tion of the previously introduced Viterbi training GTN It
suces to turn the Viterbi transformers in Figure  into
Forward Scorers that take an interpretation graph as input
an produce the forward penalty of that graph on output
Then the penalties of all the paths that contain the correct
answer are lowered instead of just that of the best one
Backpropagating through the forward penalty computa
tion the forward transformer is quite di	erent from back
propagating through a Viterbi transformer All the penal
ties of the input graph have an inuence on the forward

Several authors have applied the idea of back
propagating gradients through a forward scorer to train
speech recognition systems including Bridle and his net
model 
 and Ha	ner and his TDNN model 
 but
these authors recommended discriminative training as de
scribed in the next section
D Discriminative Forward Training
The information contained in the forward penalty can be
used in another discriminative training criterion which we
will call the discriminative forward criterion This criterion
corresponds to maximization of the posterior probability of
choosing the paths associated with the correct interpreta
tion This posterior probability is dened as the exponen
tial of the minus the constrained forward penalty normal
ized by the exponential of minus the unconstrained forward
penalty Note that the forward penalty of the constrained
graph is always larger or equal to the forward penalty of the
unconstrained interpretation graph Ideally we would like
the forward penalty of the constrained graph to be equal to
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  
the forward penalty of the complete interpretation graph
Equality between those two quantities is achieved when the
combined penalties of the paths with the correct label se
quence is negligibly small compared to the penalties of all
the other paths or that the posterior probability associ
ated to the paths with the correct interpretation is almost
 which is precisely what we want The corresponding
GTN training architecture is shown in gure 
Let the di	erence be denoted Edforw and let us call
Ccforw the forward penalty of the constrained graph and
Cforw the forward penalty of the complete interpretation
graph
Edforw  Ccforw  Cforw 
Edforw is always positive since the constrained graph is a
subset of the paths in the interpretation graph and the
forward penalty of a graph is always larger than the for ward penalty of a subgraph of this graph In the ideal case
the penalties of incorrect paths are innitely large there
fore the two penalties coincide and Edforw is zero Readers
familiar with the Boltzmann machine connectionist model
might recognize the constrained and unconstrained graphs
as analogous to the clamped
 constrained by the ob
served values of the output variable and free
 uncon
strained phases of the Boltzmann machine algorithm 

Backpropagating derivatives through the discriminative
Forward GTN distributes gradients more evenly than in the
Viterbi case Derivatives are backpropagated through the
left half of the the GTN in Figure  down to the interpre
tation graph Derivatives are negated and backpropagated
through the righthalf and the result for each arc is added
to the contribution from the left half Each arc in Gint now has a derivative Arcs that are part of a correct path
have a positive derivative This derivative is very large if
an incorrect path has a lower penalty than all the correct
paths Similarly the derivatives with respect to arcs that
are part of a lowpenalty incorrect path have a large nega
tive derivative On the other hand if the penalty of a path
associated with the correct interpretation is much smaller
than all other paths the loss function is very close to 
and almost no gradient is backpropagated The training
therefore concentrates on examples of images which yield a
classication error and furthermore it concentrates on the
pieces of the image which cause that error Discriminative
forward training is an elegant and ecient way of solving
the infamous credit assignment problem for learning ma
chines that manipulate dynamic
 data structures such as
graphs More generally the same idea can be used in all
situations where a learning machine must choose between
discrete alternative interpretations
As previously the derivatives on the interpretation graph
penalties can then be backpropagated into the character
recognizer instances Backpropagation through the char
acter recognizer gives derivatives on its parameters All the
gradient contributions for the di	erent candidate segments
are added up to obtain the total gradient associated to one
pair input image correct label sequence that is one ex
ample in the training set A step of stochastic gradient
descent can then be applied to update the parameters
E Remarks on Discriminative Training
In the above discussion the global training criterion was given a probabilistic interpretation but the individ
ual penalties on the arcs of the graphs were not There are
good reasons for that For example if some penalties are
associated to the di	erent class labels they would  have
to sum to  class posteriors or  integrate to  over the
input domain likelihoods
Let us rst discuss the rst case class posteriors normal
ization This local normalization of penalties may elimi
nate information that is important for locally rejecting all
the classes 
 eg when a piece of image does not cor
respond to a valid character class because some of the
segmentation candidates may be wrong Although an ex
plicit garbage class
 can be introduced in a probabilistic
framework to address that question some problems remain
because it is dicult to characterize such a class probabilis
tically and to train a system in this way it would require
a density model of unseen or unlabeled samples
The probabilistic interpretation of individual variables
plays an important role in the BaumWelsh algorithm
in combination with the ExpectationMaximization proce
du Unfortunately those methods cannot be applied to
discriminative training criteria and one is reduced to us
ing gradientbased methods Enforcing the normalization
of the probabilistic quantities while performing gradient
based learning is complex inecient time consuming and
creates illconditioning of the lossfunction
Following 
 we therefore prefer to postpone normal
ization as far as possible in fact until the nal decision
stage of the system Without normalization the quanti
ties manipulated in the system do not have a direct prob
abilistic interpretation
Let us now discuss the second case using a generative
model of the input Generative models build the boundary
indirectly by rst building an independent density model
for each class and then performing classication decisions
on the basis of these models This is not a discriminative
approach in that it does not focus on the ultimate goal of
learning which in this case is to learn the classication de
cision surface Theoretical arguments 
 
 suggest that
estimating input densities when the real goal is to obtain
a discriminant function for classication is a suboptimal
strategy In theory the problem of estimating densities in
highdimensional spaces is much more illposed than nd
ing decision boundaries
Even though the internal variables of the system do not
have a direct probabilistic interpretation the overall sys
tem can still be viewed as producing posterior probabilities
for the classes In fact assuming that a particular label se
quence is given as the desired sequence
 to the GTN in
gure  the exponential of minus Edforw can be inter
preted as an estimate of the posterior probability of that
label sequence given the input The sum of those posteriors
for all the possible label sequences is  Another approach would consists of directly minimizing an approximation of
the number of misclassications 


the discriminative forward loss function because it causes

see in Section XC that this is a good way to obtain scores
on which to base a rejection strategy The important point
being made here is that one is free to choose any param
eterization deemed appropriate for a classication model
The fact that a particular parameterization uses internal variables with no clear probabilistic interpretation does not

VII Multiple Object Recognition Space
Displacement Neural Network
There is a simple alternative to explicitly segmenting im
ages of character strings using heuristics The idea is to
sweep a recognizer at all possible locations across a nor
malized image of the entire word or string as shown in
Figure  With this technique no segmentation heuris
tics are required since the system essentially examines al l
the possible segmentations of the input However there
are problems with this approach First the method is in
general quite expensive The recognizer must be applied
at every possible location on the input or at least at a
large enough subset of locations so that misalignments of
characters in the eld of view of the recognizers are small
enough to have no e	ect on the error rate Second when
the recognizer is centered on a character to be recognized
the neighbors of the center character will be present in the
eld of view of the recognizer possibly touching the cen
ter character Therefore the recognizer must be able to
correctly recognize the character in the center of its input
eld even if neighboring characters are very close to or
touching the central character Third a word or charac
ter string cannot be perfectly size normalized Individual
$
Fig  A Space Displacement Neural Network is a convolutional
network that has been replicated over a wide input eld
characters within a string may have widely varying sizes
and baseline positions Therefore the recognizer must be very robust to shifts and size variations
These three problems are elegantly circumvented if a
convolutional network is replicated over the input eld
First of all as shown in section III convolutional neu
ral networks are very robust to shifts and scale varia
tions of the input image as well as to noise and extra
neous marks in the input These properties take care of
the latter two problems mentioned in the previous para
graph Second convolutional networks provide a drastic
saving in computational requirement when replicated over
large input elds A replicated convolutional network also
called a Space Displacement Neural Network or SDNN 

is shown in Figure  While scanning a recognizer can
be prohibitively expensive in general convolutional net works can be scanned or replicated very eciently over
large variablesize input elds Consider one instance of
a convolutional net and its alter ego at a nearby location
Because of the convolutional nature of the network units
in the two instances that look at identical locations on the
input have identical outputs therefore their states do not
need to be computed twice Only a thin slice
 of new
states that are not shared by the two network inances
needs to be recomputed When all the slices are put to
gether the result is simply a larger convolutional network
whose structure is identical to the original network except
that the feature maps are larger in the horizontal dimen
sion In other words replicating a convolutional network
can be done simply by increasing the size of the elds over
which the convolutions are performed and by replicating
the output layer accordingly The output layer e	ectively
becomes a convolutional layer An output whose receptive
eld is centered on an elementary ob ject will produce the
class of this ob ject while an inbetween output may indi
cate no character or contain rubbish The outputs can be
interpreted as evidences for the presence of ob jects at all
possible positions in the input eld
The SDNN architecture seems particularly attractive for
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  
recognizing cursive handwriting where no reliable segmen
tation heuristic exists Although the idea of SDNN is quite
old and very attractive by its simplicity it has not gener
ated wide interest until recently because as stated above
it puts enormous demands on the recognizer

order of magnitude smaller replicated convolutional net works are easier to implement for instance in Ha	ners

A Interpreting the Output of an SDNN with a GTN
The output of an SDNN is a sequence of vectors which
encode the likelihoods penalties or scores of nding char
acter of a particular class label at the corresponding lo
cation in the input A postprocessor is required to pull
out the best possible label sequence from this vector se
quence An example of SDNN output is shown in Fig
ure  Very often individual characters are spotted by
several neighboring instances of the recognizer a conse
quence of the robustness of the recognizer to horizontal
translations Also quite often characters are erroneously
detected by recognizer instances that see only a piece of
a character For example a recognizer instance that only
sees the right third of a 
 might output the label  How
can we eliminate those extraneous characters from the out
put sequence and pullout the best interpretation This
can be done using a new type of Graph Transformer with
two input graphs as shown in Figure  The sequence of vectors produced by the SDNN is rst coded into a linear
graph with multiple arcs between pairs of successive nodes
Each arc between a particular pair of nodes contains the
label of one of the possible categories together with the
penalty produced by the SDNN for that class label at that
location This graph is called the SDNN Output Graph The second input graph to the transformer is a grammar
transducer more specically a nitestate transducer 

that encodes the relationship between input strings of class
labels and corresponding output strings of recognized char
actersThe transducer is a weighted nite state machine a
graph where each arc contains a pair of labels and possibly
a penalty Like a nitestate machine a transducer is in a
state and follows an arc to a new state when an observed
input symbol matches the rst symbol in the symbol pair
attached to the arc At this point the transducer emits the
second symbol in the pair together with a penalty that com
bines the penalty of the input symbol and the penalty of
the arc A transducer therefore transforms a weighted sym
bol sequence into another weighted symbol sequence The
graph transformer shown in gure  performs a composi
tion between the recognition graph and the grammar trans
ducer This operation takes every possible sequence corre
sponding to every possible path in the recognition graph
and matches them with the paths in the grammar trans
ducer The composition produces the interpretation graph
which contains a path for each corresponding output label
sequence This composition operation may seem combina
torially intractable but it turns out there exists an ecient
algorithm for it described in more details in Section VIII

B Experiments with SDNN
In a series of experiments LeNet was trained with the
goal of being replicated so as to recognize multiple char
acters without segmentations The data was generated
from the previously described Modied NIST set as fol
lows Training images were composed of a central char
acter anked by two side characters picked at random in
the training set The separation between the bounding
boxes of the characters were chosen at random between 
and  pixels In other instances no central character was
present in which case the desired output of the network was the blank space class In addition training images were degraded with ! salt and pepper noise random
pixel inversions
Figures  and  show a few examples  success
ful recognitions of multiple characters by the LeNet
SDNN Standard techniques based on Heuristic Over
Segmentation would fail miserably on many of those ex
amples As can be seen on these examples the network
exhibits striking invariance and noise resistance properties
While some authors have argued that invariance requires
more sophisticated models than feedforward neural net works 
 LeNet exhibits these properties to a large ex
tent

Answer
Fig  An SDNN applied to a noisy image of digit string The digits shown in the SDNN output represent the winning class labels with
a lighter grey level for highpenalty answers
Similarly it has been suggested that accurate recognition
of multiple overlapping ob jects require explicit mechanisms
that would solve the socalled feature binding problem 

As can be seen on Figures  and  the network is able to
tell the characters apart even when they are closely inter
twined a task that would be impossible to achieve with the
more classical Heuristic OverSegmentation technique The
SDNN is also able to correctly group disconnected pieces
of ink that form characters Good examples of that are
shown in the upper half of gure  In the top left ex
ample the  and the  are more connected to each other
than they are connected with themselves yet the system
correctly identies the  and the  as separate ob jects The
top right example is interesting for several reasons First
the system correctly identies the three individual ones
Second the left half and right half of disconnected  are
correctly grouped even though no geometrical information
could decide to associate the left half to the vertical bar on
its left or on its right The right half of the  does cause
the appearance of an erroneous  on the SDNN output
but this one is removed by the character model transducer
which prevents characters from appearing on contiguous
outputs
Another important advantage of SDNN is the ease with
which they can be implemented on parallel hardware Spe
cialized analogdigital chips have been designed and used
in character recognition and in image preprocessing appli
cations 
 However the rapid progress of conventional
processor technology with reducedprecision vector arith
metic instructions such as Intels MMX make the success
of specialized hardware hypothetical at best
Short video clips of the LeNet SDNN can be viewed at
httpwwwresearchattcomyannocr C Global Training of SDNN
In the above experiments the string image were arti
cially generated from individual character The advantage
is that we know in advance the location and the label of
the important character With real training data the cor
rect sequence of labels for a string is generally available
but the precise locations of each corresponding character
in the input image are unknown
In the experiments described in the previous section the
best interpretation was extracted from the SDNN output
using a very simple graph transformer Global training of
an SDNN can be performed by backpropagating gradients
through such graph transformers arranged in architectures
similar to the ones described in section VI

Forward Criterion The top part is comparable to the top

tion graph with all the possible legal interpretations On
the left side the composition is performed with a grammar
that only contains paths with the desired sequence of la
bels This has a somewhat similar function to the path
selector used in the previous section Like in Section VID
the loss function is the di	erence between the forward score
obtained from the left half and the forward score obtained
from the right half To backpropagate through the com
position transformer we need to keep a record of which arc
in the recognition graph originated which arcs in the inter
pretation graph The derivative with respect to an arc in
the recognition graph is equal to the sum of the derivatives
with respect to all the arcs in the interpretation graph that
originated from it Derivative can also be computed for the
penalties on the grammar graph allowing to learn them as well As in the previous example a discriminative criterion must be used because using a nondiscriminative criterion
could result in a collapse e	ect if the networks output RBF
are adaptive The above training procedure can be equiv
alently formulated in term of HMM Early experiments in

online handwriting recognition

idea of globallytrained SDNNHMM hybrids SDNN is an
extremely promising and attractive technique for OCR but
so far it has not yielded better results than Heuristic Over
Segmentation We hope that these results will improve as
more experience is gained with these models
D Object Detection and Spotting with SDNN
An interesting application of SDNNs is ob ject detection
and spotting The invariance properties of Convolutional
Networks combined with the eciency with which they
can be replicated over large elds suggest that they can
be used for brute force
 ob ject spotting and detection in
large images The main idea is to train a single Convolu
tional Network to distinguish images of the ob ject of inter
est from images present in the background In utilization
mode the network is replicated so as to cover the entire
image to be analyzed thereby forming a twodimensional
Space Displacement Neural Network The output of the
SDNN is a twodimensional plane in which activated units
indicate the presence of the ob ject of interest in the corre
sponding receptive eld Since the sizes of the ob jects to
be detected within the image are unknown the image can
be presented to the network at multiple resolutions and
the results at multiple resolutions combined The idea has
been applied to face location 
 address block location
on envelopes 
 and hand tracking in video 

To illustrate the method we will consider the case of
face detection in images as described in 
 First images
containing faces at various scales are collected Those im
ages are ltered through a zeromean Laplacian lter so as
to remove variations in global illumination and low spatial
frequency illumination gradients Then training samples
of faces and nonfaces are manually extracted from those
images The face subimages are then size normalized so
that the height of the entire face is approximately  pixels
while keeping fairly large variations within a factor of two
The scale of background subimages are picked at random
A single convolutional network is trained on those samples
to classify face subimages from nonface subimages
When a scene image is to be analyzed it is rst ltered
through the Laplacian lter and subsampled at powers
oftwo resolutions The network is replicated over each of multiple resolution images A simple voting technique is
used to combine the results from multiple resolutions
A twodimensional version of the global training method
described in the previous section can be used to allevi
ate the need to manually locate faces when building the
training sample 
 Each possible location is seen as an
alternative interpretation ie one of several parallel arcs
in a simple graph that only contains a start node and an
end node
Other authors have used Neural Networks or other clas
siers such as Support Vector Machines for face detection
with great success 
 
 Their systems are very similar
to the one described above including the idea of presenting
the image to the network at multiple scales But since those
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  
systems do not use Convolutional Networks they cannot
take advantage of the speedup described here and have to
rely on other techniques such as preltering and realtime
tracking to keep the computational requirement within
reasonable limits In addition because those classiers are much less invariant to scale variations than Convolutional
Networks it is necessary to multiply the number of scales
at which the images are presented to the classier

B Standard Transduction
In the established framework of nitestate transduc
ers 
 discrete symbols are attached to arcs in the graphs
Acceptor graphs have a single symbol attached to each
arc whereas transducer graphs have two symbols an input
symbol and an output symbol A special null symbol is
absorbed by any other symbol when concatenating sym
bols to build a symbol sequence Weighted transducers
and acceptors also have a scalar quantity attached to each
arc In this framework the composition operation takes as
input an acceptor graph and a transducer graph and builds
an output acceptor graph Each path in this output graph
with symbol sequence Sout corresponds to one path with
symbol sequence Sin in the input acceptor graph and one
path and a corresponding pair of inputoutput sequences
SoutSin in the transducer graph The weights on the arcs
of the output graph are obtained by adding the weights
from the matching arcs in the input acceptor and trans
ducer graphs In the rest of the paper we will call this
graph composition operation using transducers the 	stan
dard
 transduction operation A simple example of transduction is shown in Figure 
In this simple example the input and output symbols on
the transducer arcs are always identical This type of trans
ducer graph is called a grammar graph To better under
stand the transduction operation imagine two tokens sit
ting each on the start nodes of the input acceptor graph
and the transducer graph The tokens can freely follow
any arc labeled with a null input symbol A token can
foow an arc labeled with a nonnull input symbol if the
other token also follows an arc labeled with the same in
put symbol We have an acceptable trajectory when both
tokens reach the end nodes of their graphs ie the tokens
have reached the terminal conguration This tra jectory
represents a sequence of input symbols that complies with
both the acceptor and the transducer We can then collect
the corresponding sequence of output symbols along the
tra jectory of the transducer token The above procedure
produces a tree but a simple technique described in Sec
tion VIIIC can be used to avoid generating multiple copies
of certain subgraphs by detecting when a particular output
state has already been seen
The transduction operation can be performed very e
ciently 
 but presents complex bookkeeping problems
concerning the handling of all combinations of null and non
null symbols If the weights are interpreted as probabilities
normalized appropriately then an acceptor graph repre
sents a probability distribution over the language dened
by the set of label sequences associated to all possible paths
from the start to the end node in the graph
An example of application of the transduction opera
tion is the incorporation of linguistic constraints a lexicon
or a grammar when recognizing words or other character
strings The recognition transformer produces the recog
nition graph an acceptor graph by applying the neural
network recognizer to each candidate segment This ac
ceptor graph is composed with a transducer graph for the
grammar The grammar transducer contains a path for
each legal sequence of symbol possibly augmented with
penalties to indicate the relative likelihoods of the possi
ble sequences The arcs contain identical input and output
symbols Another example of transduction was mentioned
in Section V the path selector used in the heuristic over
segmentation training GTN is implementable by a compo
sition The transducer graph is linear graph which con
tains the correct label sequence The composition of the
interpretation graph with this linear graph yields the con
strained graph
C Generalized Transduction
If the data structures associated to each arc took only
a nite number of values composing the input graph and
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  
an appropriate transducer would be a sound solution For
our applications however the data structures attached to
the arcs of the graphs may be vectors images or other
highdimensional ob jects that are not readily enumerated
We present a new composition operation that solves this
problem
Instead of only handling graphs with discrete symbols
and penalties on the arcs we are interested in considering
graphs whose arcs may carry complex data structures in
cluding continuousvalued data structures such as vectors
and images Composing such graphs requires additional
information  When examining a pair of arcs one from each input
graph we need a criterion to decide whether to create cor
responding arcs and nodes in the output graph based
on the information attached to the input arcs We can de
cide to build an arc several arcs or an entire subgraph
with several nodes and arcs  When that criterion is met we must build the corre
sponding arcs and nodes in the output graph and com
pute the information attached to the newly created arcs
as a function the the information attached to the input
arcs
These functions are encapsulated in an ob ject called a
Composition Transformer An instance of Composition
Transformer implements three methods  checkarc arc

compares the data structures pointed to by arcs arc from
the rst graph and arc from the second graph and re
turns a boolean indicating whether corresponding arcs
should be created in the output graph  fpropngraph upnode downnode arc arc

is called when checkarc arc
 returns true This
method creates new arcs and nodes between nodes upnode
and downnode in the output graph ngraph and computes
the information attached to these newly created arcs as a
function of the attached information of the input arcs arc
and arc  bpropngraph upnode downnode arc arc

is called during training in order to propagate gradient in
formation from the output subgraph between upnode and
downnode into the data structures on the arc and arc as well as with respect to the parameters that were used in
the fprop call with the same arguments This assumes that
the function used by fprop to compute the values attached
to its output arcs is di	erentiable
The check method can be seen as constructing a dy
namic architecture of functional dependencies while the
fprop method performs a forward propagation through
that architecture to compute the numerical information at
tached to the arcs The bprop method performs a back ward propagation through the same architecture to com
pute the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect
to the information attached to the arcs This is illustrated
in Figure 

jectory is acceptable ie both tokens simultaneously reach
the end nodes of their graphs The management of null
transitions is a straightforward modication of the token
simulation function Before enumerating the possible non
null joint token transitions we loop on the possible null
transitions of each token recursively call the token sim
ulation function and nally call the method fprop The
safest way for identifying acceptable tra jectories consists in
running a preliminary pass for identifying the token con
gurations from which we can reach the terminal congu
ration ie both tokens on the end nodes This is easily
achieved by enumerating the tra jectories in the opposite
direction We start on the end nodes and follow the arcs
upstream During the main pass we only build the nodes
that allow the tokens to reach the terminal conguration
Graph composition using transducers ie standard
transduction is easily and eciently implemented as a gen
eralized transduction The method check simply tests the
equality of the input symbols on the two arcs and the
method fprop creates a single arc whose symbol is the
output symbol on the transducers arc
The composition between pairs of graphs is particularly
useful for incorporating linguistic constraints in a hand
writing recognizer Examples of its use are given in the
online handwriting recognition system described in Sec
tion IX and in the check reading system described in Sec
tion X
In the rest of the paper the term Composition Trans
former will denote a Graph Transformer based on the gen
eralized transductions of multiple graphs The concept of
generalized transduction is a very general one In fact
many of the graph transformers described earlier in this
paper such as the segmenter and the recognizer c

D Notes on the Graph Structures
Section VI has discussed the idea of global training
by backpropagating gradient through simple graph trans
formers The bprop method is the basis of the back
propagation algorithm for generic graph transformers A
generalized composition transformer can be seen as dam
ically establishing functional relationships between the nu
merical quantities on the input and output arcs Once the
check function has decided that a relationship should be es
tablished the fprop function implements the numerical re
lationship The check function establishes the structure of
the ephemeral network inside the composition transformer
Since fprop is assumed to be di	erentiable gradients can
be backpropagated through that structure Most param
eters a	ect the scores stored on the arcs of the successive
graphs of the system A few threshold parameters may de
termine whether an arc appears or not in the graph Since
non existing arcs are equivalent to arcs with very large
penalties we only consider the case of parameters a	ect
ing the penalties
In the kind of systems we have discussed until now and
the application described in Section X much of the knowl
edge about the structure of the graph that is produced by
a Graph Transformer is determined by the nature of the
Graph Transformer but it may also depend on the value
of the parameters and on the input It may also be interest
ing to consider Graph Transformer modules which attempt
to learn the structure of the output graph This might
be considered a combinatorial problem and not amenable
to GradientBased Learning but a solution to this prob
lem is to generate a large graph that contains the graph
candidates as subgraphs and then select the appropriate
subgraph

E GTN and Hidden Markov Models
GTNs can be seen as a generalization and an extension of
HMMs On the one hand the probabilistic interpretation
can be either kept with penalties being logprobabilities
pushed to the nal decision stage with the di	erence of the
constrained forward penalty and the unconstrained forward
penalty being interpreted as negative logprobabilities of
label sequences or dropped altogether the network just
represents a decision surface for label sequences in input
space On the other hand Graph Transformer Networks
extend HMMs by allowing to combine in a wellprincipled
framework multiple levels of processing or multiple mod
els eg Pereira et al have been using the transducer
framework for stacking HMMs representing di	erent levels
of processing in automatic speech recognition 

Unfolding a HMM in time yields a graph that is very sim
ilar to our interpretation graph at the nal stage of pro
cessing of the Graph Transformer Network before Viterbi
recognition It has nodes nt i associated to each time
step t and state i in the model The penalty ci for an arc
from nt   j to nt i then corresponds to the nega
tive logprobability of emitting observed data ot at posi
tion t and going from state j to state i in the time interval
t   t With this probabilistic interpretation the for ward penalty is the negative logarithm of the likelihood of
whole observed data sequence given the model
In Section VI we mentioned that the collapsing phe
nomenon can occur when nondiscriminative loss functions
are used to train neural networksHMM hybrid systems
With classical HMMs with xed preprocessing this prob
lem does not occur because the parameters of the emission
and transition probability models are forced to satisfy cer
tain probabilistic constraints the sum or the integral of
the probabilities of a random variable over its possible val
ues must be  Therefore when the probability of certain
events is increased the probability of other events must au
tomatically be decreased On the other hand if the prob
abilistic assumptions in an HMM or other probabilistic
model are not realistic discriminative training discussed
in Section VI can improve performance as this has been
clearly shown for speech recognition systems

an annotated image

a replicated convolutional neural network that spots and

The network and the GTN are jointly trained to minimize
an error measure dened at the word level
In this work we have compared a system based on
SDNNs such as described in Section VII and a system
based on Heuristic OverSegmentation such as described
in Section V cause of the sequential nature of the infor
mation in the pen tra jectory which reveals more informa

nature of the signal as possible while at the same time ex
ploit the sequential information in the tra jectory For this
purpose we have designed a representation scheme called

B Network Architecture
One of the best networks we found for both online and
o%ine character recognition is a layer convolutional net work somewhat similar to LeNet Figure  but with multiple input planes and di	erent numbers of units on the
last two layers$ layer  convolution with  kernels of size
x layer  x subsampling layer  convolution with
 kernels of size x layer  convolution with  kernels
of size x layer  x subsampling classication layer
 RBF units one per class in the full printable ASCII
set The distributed codes on the output are the same as
for LeNet except they are adaptive unlike with LeNet
When used in the heuristic oversegmentation system the
input to above network consisted of an AMAP with ve
planes  rows and  columns It was determined that
this resolution was sucient for representing handwritten
characters In the SDNN version the number of columns was varied according to the width of the input word Once
the number of subsampling layers and the sizes of the ker
nels are chosen the sizes of all the layers including the
input are determined unambiguously The only architec
tural parameters that remain to be selected are the num
ber of feature maps in each layer and the information as
to what feature map is connected to what other feature
map In our case the subsampling rates were chosen as
small as possible x and the kernels as small as pos

sible in the rst layer x to limit the total number of
connections Kernel sizes in the upper layers are chosen to
be as small as possible while satisfying the size constraints
mentioned above Larger architectures did not necessarily
perform better and required considerably more time to be
trained A very small architecture with half the input eld
also performed worse because of insucient input resolu
tion Note that the input resolution is nonetheless much
less than for optical character recognition because the an
gle and curvature provide more information than would a
single grey level at each pixel
C Network Training
Training proceeded in two phases First we kept the
centers of the RBFs xed and trained the network weights
so as to minimize the output distance of the RBF unit
corresponding to the correct class This is equivalent to
minimizing the meansquared error between the previous
layer and the center of the correctclass RBF This boot
strap phase was performed on isolated characters In the
second phase all the parameters network weights and RBF
centers were trained globally to minimize a discriminative
criterion at the word level
With the Heuristic OverSegmentation approach the
GTN was composed of four main Graph Transformers
 The Segmentation Transformer performs the
Heuristic OverSegmentation and outputs the segmenta
tion graph An AMAP is then computed for each image
attached to the arcs of this graph
 The Character Recognition Transformer applies
the the convolutional network character recognizer to each
candidate segment and outputs the recognition graph
with penalties and classes on each arc
 The Composition Transformer composes the recog
nition graph with a grammar graph representing a language
model incorporating lexical constraints
 The Beam Search Transformer extracts a good inter
pretation from the interpretation graph This task could
have been achieved with the usual Viterbi Transformer
The Beam Search algorithm however implements pruning
strategies which are appropriate for large interpretation
graphs
With the SDNN approach the main Graph Transformers
are the following
 The SDNN Transformer replicates the convolutional
network over the a whole word image and outputs a recog
nition graph that is a linear graph with class penalties for
every window centered at regular intervals on the input
image
 The CharacterLevel Composition Transformer
composes the recognition graph with a lefttoright HMM
for each character class as in Figure 
 The WordLevel Composition Transformer com
poses the output of the previous transformer with a lan
guage model incorporating lexical constraints and outputs
the interpretation graph
 The Beam Search Transformer extracts a good in
terpretation from the interpretation graph
In this application the language model simply constrains
the nal output graph to represent sequences of character
labels from a given dictionary Furthermore the interpre
tation graph is not actually completely instantiated the
only nodes created are those that are needed by the Beam
Search module The interpretation graph is thereforrep
resented procedurally rather than explicitly A crucial contribution of this research was the joint train
ing of all graph transformer modules within the network
with respect to a single criterion as explained in Sec
tions VI and VIII We used the Discriminative Forward loss
function on the nal output graph minimize the forward
penalty of the constrained interpretation ie along all the
correct
 paths while maximizing the forward penalty of
the whole interpretation graph ie along all the paths
During global training the loss function was optimized
with the stochastic diagonal LevenbergMarquardt proce
dure described in Appendix C that uses second derivatives
to compute optimal learning rates This optimization op
erates on al l the parameters in the system most notably
the network weights and the RBF centers

ization ability of the neural network classier coupled with
the word normalization preprocessing and AMAP input

X A Check Reading System
This section describes a GTN based Check Reading Sys
tem intended for immediate industrial deployment It also
shows how the use of Gradient BasedLearning and GTNs
make this deployment fast and coste	ective while yielding
an accurate and reliable solution
The verication of the amount on a check is a task that
is extremely time and money consuming for banks As a
consequence there is a very high interest in automating the
process as much as possible see for example 
 


 Even a partial automation would result in consid
erable cost reductions The threshold of economic viability
for automatic check readers as set by the bank is when
! of the checks are read with less than ! error The
other ! of the check being rejected and sent to human
operators In such a case we describe the performance of
the system as  correct 
  reject 
  error The
system presented here was one of the rst to cross that
threshold on representative mixtures of business and per
sonal checks
Checks contain at least two versions of the amount The
Courtesy amount is written with numerals while the Legal
amount is written with letters On business checks which
are generally machineprinted these amounts are relatively
easy to read but quite dicult to nd due to the lack of
standard for business check layout On the other hand
these amounts on personal checks are easy to nd but much
harder to read
For simplicity and speed requirements our initial task
is to read the Courtesy amount only This task consists of
two main steps  The system has to nd among all the elds lines of
text the candidates that are the most likely to contain the
courtesy amount This is obvious for many personal checks
where the position of the amount is standardized However
as already noted nding the amount can be rather dicult
in business checks even for the human eye There are
many strings of digits such as the check number the date
or even not to exceed
 amounts that can be confused
with the actual amount In many cases it is very dicult
to decide which candidate is the courtesy amount before
performing a full recognition  In order to read and choose some Courtesy amount
candidates the system has to segment the elds into char
acters read and score the candidate characters and nally
nd the best interpretation of the amount using contextual
knowledge represented by a stochastic grammar for check
amounts
The GTN methodology was used to build a check amount
reading system that handles both personal checks and busi
ness checks
A A GTN for Check Amount Recognition
We now describe the successive graph transformations
that allow this network to read the check amount cf Fig
ure  Each Graph Transformer produces a graph whose
paths encode and score the current hypotheses considered
at this stage of the system
The input to the system is a trivial graph with a single
arc that carries the image of the whole check cf Figure 
The eld location transformer Tf ield rst performs
classical image analysis including connected component
analysis ink density histograms layout analysis etc
and heuristically extracts rectangular zones that may con
tain the check amount Tf ield produces an output graph
called the eld graph cf Figure  such that each can
didate zone is associated with one arc that links the start
node to the end node Each arc contains the image of the
zone and a penalty term computed from simple features
extracted from the zone absolute position size aspect ra
tio etc The penalty term is close to zero if the features
suggest that the eld is a likely candidate and is large if
the eld is deemed less likely to be an amount The penal

function is di	erentiable therefore its parameter are glob
ally tunable
An arc may represent separate dollar and cent amounts
as a sequence of elds In fact in handwritten checks the
cent amount may be written over a fractional bar and not
aligned at all with the dollar amount In the worst case
one may nd several cent amount candidates above and
below the fraction bar for the same dollar amount
The segmentation transformer Tseg  similar to the
one described in Section VIII examines each zone contained
in the eld graph and cuts each image into pieces of ink
using heuristic image processing techniques Each piece
of ink may be a whole character or a piece of character
Each arc in the eld graph is replaced by its correspond
ing segmentation graph that represents all possible group
ings of pieces of ink Each eld segmentation graph is ap
pended to an arc that contains the penalty of the eld in
the eld graph Each arc carries the segment image to
gether with a penalty that provides a rst evaluation of
the likelihood that the segment actually contains a charac
ter This penalty is obtained with a di	erentiable function
that combines a few simple features such as the space be
tween the pieces of ink or the compliance of the segment
image with a global baseline and a few tunable parame
ters The segmentation graph represents al l the possible
segmentations of al l the eld images We can compute the
penalty for one segmented eld by adding the arc penalties
along the corresponding path As before using a di	eren
tiable function for computing the penalties will ensure that
the parameters can be optimized globally
The segmenter uses a variety of heuristics to nd candi
date cut One of the most important ones is called hit and
deect
 
 The idea is to cast lines downward from the
top of the eld image When a line hits a black pixel it is
deected so as to follow the contour of the ob ject When a
line hits a local minimum of the upper prole ie when it
cannot continue downward without crossing a black pixel
it is just propagated vertically downward through the ink
When two such lines meet each other they are merged into
a single cut The procedure can be repeated from the bot
tom up This strategy allows the separation of touching
characters such as double zeros
The recognition transformer Trec iterates over all
segment arcs in the segmentation graph and runs a charac
ter recognizer on the corresponding segment image In our
case the recognizer is LeNet the Convolutional Neural
Network described in Section II whose weights constitute
the largest and most important subset of tunable parame
ters The recognizer classies segment images into one of
 classes full printable ASCII set plus a rubbish class for
unknown symbols or badlyformed characters Each arc in
the input graph Trec is replaced by  arcs in the output
graph Each of those  arcs contains the label of one of
the classes and a penalty that is the sum of the penalty
of the corresponding arc in the input segmentation graph
and the penalty associated with classifying the image in
the corresponding class as computed by the recognizer In
other words the recognition graph represents a weighted
trellis of scored character classes Each path in this graph
represents a possible character string for the correspond
ing eld We can compute a penalty for this interpretation
by adding the penalties along the path This sequence of
characters may or may not be a valid check amount
The composition transformer Tgram selects the
paths of the recognition graph that represent valid char
acter sequences for check amounts This transformer takes
two graphs as input the recognition graph and the gram
mar graph The grammar graph contains all possible se
quences of symbols that constitute a wellformed amount
The output of the composition transformer called the in
terpretation graph contains all the paths in the recognition
graph that are compatible with the grammar The oper
ation that combines the two input graphs to produce the
output is a generalized transduction see Section VIIIA
di	erentiable function is used to compute the data attached
o the output arc from the data attached to the input arcs
In our case the output arc receives the class label of the
two arcs and a penalty computed by simply summing the
penalties of the two input arcs the recognizer penalty and
the arc penalty in the grammar graph Each path in the
interpretation graph represents one interpretation of one
segmentation of one eld on the check The sum of the
penalties along the path represents the badness
 of the
corresponding interpretation and combines evidence from
each of the modules along the process as well as from the
graar
The Viterbi transformer nally selects the path with
the lowest accumulated penalty corresponding to the best

B GradientBased Learning
Each stage of this check reading system contains tun
able parameters While some of these parameters could be
manually adjusted for example the parameters of the eld
locator and segmenter the vast ma jority of them must be
learned particularly the weights of the neural net recog
nizer
Prior to globally optimizing the system each module pa
rameters are initialized with reasonable values The param
eters of the eld locator and the segmenter are initialized
by hand while the parameters of the neural net charac
ter recognizer are initialized by training on a database of
presegmented and labeled characters Then the entire
system is trained globally from whole check images labeled
with the correct amount No explicit segmentation of the
amounts is needed to train the system it is trained at the
check level
The loss function E minimized by our global train
ing procedure is the Discriminative Forward criterion de
scribed in Section VI the di	erence between a the for ward penalty of the constrained interpretation graph con
strained by the correct label sequence and b the forward
penalty of the unconstrained interpretation graph Deriva
tives can be backpropagated through the entire structure
although it only practical to do it down to the segmenter
C Rejecting Low Condence Checks
In order to be able to reject checks which are the most
likely to carry erroneous Viterbi answers we must rate
them with a condence and reject the check if this con
dence is below a given threshold To compare the un
normalized Viterbi Penalties of two di	erent checks would
be meaningless when it comes to decide which answer we
trust the most
The optimal measure of condence is the probability of
the Viterbi answer given the input image As seen in Sec
tion VIE given a target sequence which in this case would be the Viterbi answer the discriminative forward
loss function is an estimate of the logarithm of this prob
ability Therefore a simple solution to obtain a good esti
mate of the condence is to reuse the interpretation graph
see Figure  to compute the discriminative forward loss
as described in Figure  using as our desired sequence the
Viterbi answer This is summarized in Figure  with

D Results
A version of the above system was fully implemented
and tested on machineprint business checks This sys
tem is basically a generic GTN engine with task specic
heuristics encapsulated in the check and fprop method
As a consequence the amount of code to write was min
imal mostly the adaptation of an earlier segmenter into
the segmentation transformer The system that deals with
handwritten or personal checks was based on earlier im
plementations that used the GTN concept in a restricted way The neural network classier was initially trained on
 images of character images from various origins
spanning the entire printable ASCII set This contained
both handwritten and machineprinted characters that had
been previously size normalized at the string level Addi
tional images were generated by randomly distorting the
original images using simple ane transformations of the
images The network was then further trained on character
images that had been automatically segmented from check
images and manually truthed The network was also ini
tially trained to reject noncharacters that resulted from
segmentation errors The recognizer was then inserted
the check reading system and a small subset of the parame
ters were trained globally at the eld level on whole check
images
On  business checks that were automatically catego
rized as machine printed the performance was ! cor
rectly recognized checks ! errors and ! rejects This
can be compared to the performance of the previous sys
tem on the same test set ! correct ! errors and
! rejects A check is categorized as machineprinted
when characters that are near a standard position Dollar
sign are detected as machine printed or when if nothing
is found in the standard position at least one courtesy
amount candidate is found somewhere else The improve
ment is attributed to three main causes First the neural
network recognizer was bigger and trained on more data
Second because of the GTN architecture the new system
could take advantage of grammatical constraints in a much
more eent way than the previous system Third the
GTN architecture provided extreme exibility for testing
heuristics adjusting parameters and tuning the system
This last point is more important than it seems The GTN
framework separates the algorithmic
 part of the system
from the kwledgebased
 part of the system allowing
easy adjustmes of the latter The importance of global
training was only minor in this task because the global
training only concerned a small subset of the parameters
An independent test performed by systems integrators
in  showed the superiority of this system over other
commercial Courtesy amount reading systems The system
was integrated in NCRs line of check reading systems It

XI Conclusions
During the short history of automatic pattern recogni
tion increasing the role of learning seems to have invari
ably improved the overall performance of recognition sys
tems The systems described in this paper are more ev
idence to this fact Convolutional Neural Networks have
been shown to eliminate the need for handcrafted fea
ture extractors Graph Transformer Networks have been
shown to reduce the need for handcrafted heuristics man
ual labeling and manual parameter tuning in document
recognition systems As training data becomes plentiful as
computers get faster as our understanding of learning al
gorithms improves recognition systems will rely more and
more of learning and their performance will improve
Just as the backpropagation algorithm elegantly solved
the credit assignment problem in multilayer neural net works the gradientbased learning procedure for Graph
Transformer Networks introduced in this paper solves the
credit assignment problem in systems whose functional ar
chitecture dynamically changes with each new input The
learning algorithms presented here are in a sense nothing
more than unusual forms of gradient descent in complex
dynamic architectures with ecient backpropagation al
gorithms to compute the gradient The results in this pa
per help establish the usefulness and relevance of gradient
based minimization methods as a general organizing prin
ciple for learning in large systems
It was shown that all the steps of a document analysis
system can be formulated as graph transformers through
which gradients can be backpropagated Even in the
nontrainable parts of the system the design philosophy
in terms of graph transformation provides a clear separa
tion between domainspecic heuristics eg segmentation
heuristics and generic procedural knowledge the gener
alized transduction algorithm
It is worth pointing out that data generating models
such as HMMs and the Maximum Likelihood Principle were not called upon to justify most of the architectures
and the training criteria described in this paper Gradient
based learning applied to global discriminative loss func
tions guarantees optimal classication and rejection with
out the use of hard to justify
 principles that put strong
constraints on the system architecture often at the expense
of performances
More specically the methods and architectures pre
sented in this paper o	er generic solutions to a large num
ber of problems encountered in pattern recognition sys
tems
 Feature extraction is traditionally a xed transform
generally derived from some expert prior knowledge about
the task This relies on the probably incorrect assumption
that the human designer is able to capture all the rele vant information in the input We have shown that the
application of GradientBased Learning to Convolutional
Neural Networks allows to learn appropriate features from
examples The success of this approach was demonstted
in extensive comparative digit recognition experiments on
the NIST database
 Segmentation and recognition of ob jects in images can
not be completely decoupled Instead of taking hard seg
mentation decisions too early we have used Heuristic Over
Segmentation to generate and evaluate a large number of
hypotheses in parallel postponing any decision until the
overall criterion is minimized
 Hand truthing images to obtain segmented characters
for training a character recognizer is expensive and does
not take into account the way in which a whole document
or sequence of characters will be recognized in particular
the fact that some segmentation candidates may be wrong
even though they may look like true characters Instead we train multimodule systems to optimize a global mea
sure of performance which does not require time consum
ing detailed handtruthing and yields signicantly better
recognition performance because it allows to train these
modules to cooperate towards a common goal
 Ambiguities inherent in the segmentation character
recognition and linguistic model should be integrated op
timally Instead of using a sequence of taskdependent
heuristics to combine these sources of information we
have proposed a unied framework in which generalized
transduction methods are applied to graphs representing a weighted set of hypotheses about the input The success of
this approach was demonstrated with a commercially de
ployed check reading system that reads millions of business
and personal checks per day the generalized transduction
engine resides in only a few hundred lines of code
 Traditional recognition systems rely on many hand
crafted heuristics to isolate individually recognizable ob
jects The promising Space Displacement Neural Network
approach draws on the robustness and eciency of Con volutional Neural Networks to avoid explicit segmentation
altogether Simultaneous automatic learning of segmenta
tion and recognition can be achieved with GradientBased
Learning methods
This paper presents a small number of examples of graph
transformer modules but it is clear that the concept can be
applied to many situations where the domain knowledge or
the state information can be represented by graphs This is
the case in many audio signal recognition tasks and visual
scene analysis applications Future work will attempt to
apply Graph Transformer Networks to such problems with
the hope of allowing more reliance on automatic learning
and less on detailed engineering
Appendices
A Preconditions for faster convergence
As seen before the squashing function used in our Con volutional Networks is f a  A tanhSa Symmetric
functions are believed to yield faster convergence although
the learning can become extremely slow if the weights are
too small The cause of this problem is that in weight space
the origin is a xed point of the learning dynamics and
PROC OF THE IEEE NOVEMBER  	
although it is a saddle point it is attractive in almost all
directions 
 For our simulations we use A  
and S  

see 
 
 With this choice of parame
ters the equalities f    and f    are satised
The rationale behind this is that the overall gain of the
squashing transformation is around  in normal operat
ing conditions and the interpretation of the state of the
network is simplied Moreover the absolute value of the
second derivative of f is a maximum at  and  which
improves the convergence towards the end of the learning
session This particular choice of parameters is merely a
convenience and does not a	ect the result
Before training the weights are initialized with random
values using a uniform distribution between Fi and
Fi where Fi is the number of inputs fanin of the unit
which the connection belongs to Since several connections
share a weight this rule could be dicult to apply but in
our case all connections sharing a same weight belong to
units with identical fanins The reason for dividing by the
fanin is that we would like the initial standard deviation
of the weighted sums to be in the same range for each
unit and to fall within the normal operating region of the
sigmoid If the initial weights are too small the gradients
are very small and the learning is slow If they are too
large the sigmoids are saturated and the gradient is also very small The standard deviation of the weighted sum
scales like the square root of the number of inputs when
the inputs are independent and it scales linearly with the number of inputs if the inputs are highly correlated We
chose to assume the second hypothesis since some units
receive highly correlated signals
B Stochastic Gradient vs Batch Gradient
GradientBased Learning algorithms can use one of two
classes of methods to update the parameters The rst
method dubbed Batch Gradient
 is the classical one the
gradients are accumulated over the entire training set and
the parameters are updated after the exact gradient has
been so computed In the second method called Stochas
tic Gradient
 a partial or noisy gradient is evaluated on
the basis of one single training sample or a small num
ber of samples and the parameters are updated using
this approximate gradient The training samples can be
selected randomly or according to a properly randomized
sequence In the stochastic version the gradient estimates
are noisy but the parameters are updated much more often
than with the batch version An empirical result of con
siderable practical importance is that on tasks with large
redundant data sets the stochastic version is considerably
faster than the batch version sometimes by orders of mag
nitude 
 Although the reasons for this are not totally
understood theoretically an intuitive explanation can be
found in the following extreme example Let us take an
example where the training database is composed of two
copies of the same subset Then accumulating the gradient
over the whole set would cause redundant computations
to be performed On the other hand running Stochas
tic Gradient once on this training set would amount to
performing two complete learning iterations over the small
subset This idea can be generalized to training sets where
there exist no precise repetition of the same pattern but
where some redundancy is present In fact stochastic up
date must be better when there is redundancy ie when a
certain level of generalization is expected
Many authors have claimed that secondorder meth
ods should be used in lieu of gradient descent for neu
ral net training The literature abounds with recom
mendations 
 for classical secondorder methods such
as the GaussNewton or LevenbergMarquardt algorithms
for QuasiNewton methods such as the BroydenFletcher
GoldfarbShanno method BFGS Limitedstorage BFGS
or for various versions of the Conjugate Gradients CG
method Unfortunately all of the above methods are un
suitable for training large neural networks on large data
sets The GaussNewton and LevenbergMarquardt meth
ods require ON
 operations per update where N is
the number of parameters which makes them impracti
cal for even moderate size networks QuasiNewton meth
ods require only
 ON
 operations per update but that
still makes them impractical for large networks Limited
Storage BFGS and Conjugate Gradient require only ON
operations per update so they would appear appropriate
Unfortunately their convergence speed relies on an accu
rate evaluation of successive conjugate descent directions

which only makes sense in batch
 mode For large data
sets the speedup brought by these methods over regular
batch gradient descent cannot match the enormous speed
up brought by the use of stochastic gradient Several au
thors have attempted to use Conjugate Gradient with small
batches or batches of increasing sizes 
 
 but those
attempts have not yet been demonstrated to surpass a care
fully tuned stochastic gradient Our experiments were per
formed with a stochastic method that scales the parameter
axes so as to minimize the eccentricity of the error surface
C Stochastic Diagonal LevenbergMarquardt
Owing to the reasons given in Appendix B we prefer to
update the weights after each presentation of a single pat
tern in accordance with stochastic update methods The
patterns are presented in a constant random order and the
training set is typically repeated  times
Our update algorithm is dubbed the Stochastic Diagonal
LevenbergMarquardt method where an individual learning
rate step size is computed for each parameter weight
before each pass through the training set 
 
 

These learning rates are computed using the diagonal terms
of an estimate of the GaussNewton approximation to the
Hessian second derivative matrix This algorithm is not
believed to bring a tremendous increase in learning speed
but it converges reliably without requiring extensive ad
justments of the learning parameters It corrects ma jor ill
conditioning of the loss function that are due to the pecu
liarities of the network architecture and the training data
The additional cost of using this procedure over standard
stochastic gradient descent is negligible

Unfortunately using those derivatives leads to wellknown
problems associated with every Newtonlike algorithm
these terms can be negative and can cause the gradient
algorithm to move uphill instead of downhill Therefore
our second approximation is a wellknown trick called the
GaussNewton approximation which guarantees that the
second derivative estimates are nonnegative The Gauss
Newton approximation essentially ignores the nonlinearity
of the estimated function the Neural Network in our case
but not that of the loss function The backpropagation
equation for GaussNewton approximations of the second
derivatives is

This is very similar to the formula for backpropagating the
rst derivatives except that the sigmoids derivative and
the weight values are squared The righthand side is a sum
of products of nonnegative terms therefore the lehand
side term is nonnegative
The third approximation we make is that we do not run
the average in Equation  over the entire training set but
run it on a small subset of the training set instead In
addition the reestimation does not need to be done of
ten since the second order properties of the error surface
change rather slowly In the experiments described in this
paper we reestimate the hkk on  patterns before each
training pass through the training set Since the size of the
training set is  the additional cost of reestimating
the hkk is negligible The estimates are not particularly
sensitive to the particular subset of the training set used in
the averaging This seems to suggest that the secondorder
properties of the error surface are mainly determined by
the structure of the network rather than by the detailed
statistics of the samples This algorithm is particularly use
ful for sharedweight networks because the weight sharing
creates illconditionning of the error surface Because of
the sharing one single parameter in the rst few layers can
have an enormous inuence on the output Consequently the second derivative of the error with respect to this pa
rameter may be very large while it can be quite small for
other parameters elsewhere in the network The above al
gorithm compensates for that phenomenon
Unlike most other secondorder acceleration methods for
backpropagation the above method works in stochastic
mode It uses a diagonal approximation of the Hessian
Like the classical LevenbergMarquardt algorithm it uses a
safety
 factor 
 to prevent the step sizes from getting too
large if the second derivative estimates are small Hence
the method is called the Stochastic Diagonal Levenberg
Marquardt method
