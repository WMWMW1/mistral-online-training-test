broadcasting mechanism in mathematics, particularly in programming languages like Python and frameworks like PyTorch. Broadcasting is a technique that allows elementwise operations on arrays of different shapes. It works by expanding one or both arrays involved in an operation so that they have the same shape, and then performing the elementwise operations. Usually, broadcasting is applied along a dimension where an array initially has a length of 1.

If you have any questions or need further clarification about the broadcasting mechanism or how it is implemented in Python or PyTorch, feel free to ask!
